                On a coordinate plane large enough so that all of these features can be clearly visible, sketch the graph <m>y = f(x)</m> of a function which meets <em>all five</em> of the following criteria.</p>
            
            <p>Label and briefly explain how each criterion is visible on your graph. (You do not need to find a formula for your function.)
