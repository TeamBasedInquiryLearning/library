### Automated Setup

Upon first creating your Codespace, it will automatically install several
pieces of software for you. While this is running, you should see something
like this message:

```
Use Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P -> View Creation Log to see full logs
✔ Finishing up...
⠏ Running postCreateCommand...
  › bash scripts/setup.sh
```

You can edit files while this happens, but live previews of the library will not
be available until this process is complete. However, this is a one-time process;
future boot-ups of your Codespace will be ready to show live previews instantly.

### Live CodeChat Previews

Once this software is installed, you can edit a book with live previews
by selecting "Preview file with CodeChat" from the PreTeXt menu in the bottom toolbar.
You will now be able to see live previews of most `.ptx` files for that book in a side panel.
