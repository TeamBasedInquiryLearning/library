        <title>What Kinds of Problems Will Appear on Problem Sets?</title>
        <p>
            Different types of problems assess different learning outcomes and promote the development of different skills and habits. 
            To help you better understand the kind of problems that you will encounter your problem set (and why you are encountering them), it is instructive to examine the basic types of problems that make up this TBIL course, as described in <url href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511970.2019.1666440">Team-Based Inquiry Learning</url>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Broadly speaking, the problems that you encounter in this course (both inside and outside of the classroom) fall into the following types:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Scaffolded Exploration</em> problems introduce you to a new concept through a sequence of carefully scaffolded activities. 
                        These activities include exploratory activities to motivate an entire line of thinking; working a series of examples to have students realize the need for a new definition; and working a carefully scaffolded problem to develop a general algorithm for solving similar problems, for example.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Fluency Builders</em> are designed to help you develop fluency in a new concept. 
                        You will work on such problems both in-class with your teammates after learning a new concepts, but also outside of class while you study. 
                        All of the problems that you will see on Fluency Assessments are Fluency Builders.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Flexible Extensions</em> are problems that require you to apply a concept in a new setting. 
                        These problems can take a variety of forms and include: checking if something satisfies a new definition; extending an idea from its <q>natural</q> setting to something more general; or, a true application to another field or topic.
                        In these activities, the emphasis is on developing a flexible mindset when faced with new problems.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            The most common types of problems that you will work on in class are Scaffolded Explorations and Fluency Builders. 
            In contrast, your Problem Sets will largely priortize Flexible Extensions. 
        </p>

        <title>How Will You Be Evaluated?</title>
        <p>
            Each Problem Set in this course will contain five (5) problems. 
            For each problem, your task is to solve the problem and prepare a written solution to it.
            You will then upload your solutions to Gradescope as a single .pdf file, as instruced on Canvas. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <alert>Written solutions are more than just answers.</alert>
            A complete solution to a problem:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        clearly states what the answer to the problem is;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        explains why the claimed answer is indeed the correct answer;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        is grounded in sound mathematical reasoning that builds on and/or refers directly to results, Facts, or Activities that we have explored in class;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        is written for an audience of a typical classmate; that is, someone who is generally new to these ideas and has the resources and experiences provided in this Activity Book.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            For each problem on your problem set, you will receive a total score of at most 5 points; three (3) of those points are for <em>Problem Solving</em> and two (2) of those points are for <em>Communication</em>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Problem Solving (3 Points)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The solution uses methods covered in class, is grounded in mathematical reasoning, and solves the problem, when executed accurately.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    All key ideas required to solve the problem are introduced in a clear and concise manner.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    The solution is well-written, audience appropriate, and follows principles of good mathematical writing (explained more below).
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Mathematical terms and notations are used correctly, and Theorem and Facts are cited appropriately.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Solutions are uploaded to gradescope properly with all relevant pages selected for each question.
                                </p>
                            </li>

            </ul> 

            In order to grade your work fairly and consistently among our varied sections, the teaching team will meet prior to assessing the Problem Sets in order to decide how to interpret these criteria for each problem on your Problem Set.
        </p>
        <p>
            After your Problem Set is returned to you, <alert>you will be provided an opportunity to reflect on the feedback that you were given and earn one (1) additional point on your Problem Set</alert>.

                    This is a short guide to writing mathematics well by Francis Su (Harvey Mudd College).

                Like all forms of writing, it will take practice, and the incorporation of feedback, to feel confident in writing mathematics well. 
                While it may feel like it at the beginning, we want to stress that our goal is not to have you write the exact same way that we do. 
                Rather, we want you to be able to express yourself precisely, so that you may share your ideas and perspectives accurately with the greater community.
