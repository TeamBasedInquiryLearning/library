         <p> On both sides of <m>x=2</m> it seems that the slope is the same, but this function is still not differentiable at <m>x=2</m>. Notice that <m>g(2)=4</m>. When <m> h \gt 0 </m>, the interval <m>[2,2+h]</m>falls under the second definition of <m>g(x)</m>, but <m>g(2)</m> is always fixed at 4. Compute the difference quotient <m>\frac{g(2+h)-g(2)}{h}</m> assuming that <m>h \gt 0 </m> and notice that this does not simplify as expected! Moreover, if you take the limit as <m>h\to 0</m>, you will get infinity and not the expected slope of 1!

              Consider the following function </p><me>
                g(x) = \begin{cases}
                  ax + 2 \amp x \leq 2 \\
                  bx^2   \amp x \gt  2
                \end{cases}
              </me>
         <p> where <m>a,b</m> are some nonzero parameters you will find. Find an equation in <m>a,b</m> that needs to be true if we want the function to be continuous at <m>x=2</m>. Also, find an equation in <m>a,b</m> that needs to be true if we want the function to be differentiable at <m>x=2</m>. Solve the system of two linear equations... you should find that <m>a=-2</m> and <m>b=-1/2</m> are the only values that make the function differentiable (and continuous!).
