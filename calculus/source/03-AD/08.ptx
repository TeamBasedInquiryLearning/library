              Determine a <em>function of a single variable</em> that models the quantity to be optimized;
              this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.
              For example, in <xref ref="activity-ad8-box"/>,
              we initially found that <m>V = l \times w \times h </m>,

          The problem statement tells us that the parcel's girth plus length (<m>P</m>) may not exceed 108 inches.
          In order to maximize volume,
          we assume that we will actually need the girth plus length <m>P</m> to equal 108 inches.

      <remark xml:id="AD8-remark2">
       <p>  Notice that a critical point might or might not be an global maximum or minimum, so just finding the critical points is not enough to answer an optimization problem. Moreover, some of the critical points might be outside of the domain imposed by the context and thus they cannot be feasible optimal points. </p>
