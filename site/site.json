This\nhighly active and structured pedagogy provides scaffolding that allows\nmathematics students to engage in\n<a href=\"https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201706/rnoti-p570.pdf\">Inquiry-Based Learning</a>\n(IBL) in courses as early as precalculus.\n</p>\n<p class=\"notice\">\nWe developed <strong>Team-Based Inquiry Learning</strong> (TBIL) to combine\nthe scaffolding of TBL with the rich inquiry of IBL. This site includes several\nactivity books, exercise banks, research findings, and more, made available\nto you as free and open-source resources for your classroom.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n    <a class=\"button\" href=\"./about/\">Learn more!</a>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under\n<a href=\"https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2011807\">Award #2011807</a>.\nAny opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those \nof the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n    <a href=\"https://nsf.gov\"><image style=\"max-width:200px\" src=\"./static/nsf.png\"></a>\n</p>\n"
