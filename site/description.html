<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team-based_learning">Team-Based Learning</a> (TBL)
was first popularized for use in management and health sciences education. This
highly active and structured pedagogy provides scaffolding that allows
mathematics students to engage in
<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201706/rnoti-p570.pdf">Inquiry-Based Learning</a>
(IBL) in courses as early as precalculus.

We developed <strong>Team-Based Inquiry Learning</strong> (TBIL) to combine
the scaffolding of TBL with the rich inquiry of IBL. This site includes several
activity books, exercise banks, research findings, and more, made available
to you as free and open-source resources for your classroom.
