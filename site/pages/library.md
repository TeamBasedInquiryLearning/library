### Open Education

To maximize the impact of our work, we offer our
TBIL Resource Library
as free and open-source materials, with no paywalls or
verification required prior to use.

All source files are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeamBasedInquiryLearning/library) under
[open licenses](https://github.com/TeamBasedInquiryLearning/library/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
allowing for the use, remixing, and distribution of all materials.

**Instructors:**
Are our materials helpful for your classroom? If so, we ask that you complete
[this survey](https://forms.gle/bgf8dEH9mrWg1cvm9) so we can know!
