To maximize the impact of our work, we offer our TBIL Resource Library
as free and open-source materials, with no paywalls or
verification required prior to use.

All source files are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeamBasedInquiryLearning/library) under
[open licenses](https://github.com/TeamBasedInquiryLearning/library/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
allowing for the use, remixing, and distribution of all materials.

Our [wiki](https://github.com/TeamBasedInquiryLearning/library/wiki)
describes how community members can contribute to future editions of the library
to make our work even more impactful!
