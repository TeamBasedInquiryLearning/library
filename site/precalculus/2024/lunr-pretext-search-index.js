  "title": "For Instructors",
  "body": " For Instructors   Welcome to our first edition!  We're excited to share with you our first edition of Precalculus for Team-Based Inquiry Learning! These activities, which mostly cover topics from College Algebra, are being used in a few classrooms for the first time in Fall 2024. More activities are being designed to be included in our 2025 editions, with a goal of fully supporting Precalculus courses in Fall 2025. Similarly, our exercise bank is a work-in-progress.  We're providing this first edition for those who are eager to try out TBIL in their precalculus classrooms, with the understanding that this book will likely change a lot between now and our next edition, once we've tried it in our own classrooms! Are you interested in joining the community using these materials, and possibly contributing back to these free and open-source resources? Join the conversation at ; we look forward to hearing from you, particularly if you have feedback from your students on these activities.    Features of the text  The book is organized into Modules. You can think of a module as a chapter in a textbook.  In a TBIL course, each module starts with a Readiness Assurance Process to check understanding of and and solidify prerequisite knowledge (from other courses or previous modules) that will be needed in the upcoming module. The front page for each module provides a list of these Readiness Assurance outcomes, along with study resources and exercise students can use to refresh themselve on this prerequisite knowledge. Readiness Assurance Tests that assess this knowledge are available as part of the TBIL Resource Libary (see ). Join the TBIL community (see ) to gain access to these.  Within each module there is a varying amount of sections, one per learning outcome. Each section is designed to guide students into being able to demonstrate their understanding of that specific outcome. The learning outcome can be tested with a CheckIt Exercise, which are linked at the end of each section.  Within each section, students engage in Activities, which are interpersed with definitions, theorems, remarks, examples, etc. as needed to guide the learning process. The activities start in an exploratory way then building the concepts on the results of this exploration. The concepts are then practiced with less scaffolding to build fluency. Finally, towards the end of the section we connect the concepts and extend them to new settings.  Each section\/learning outcome is designed with an exercise, a specific set of tasks, that the students need to be able to solve to demonstrate their competency. Virtually limitless randomized versions of the exercise can be generated via CheckIt to build a problem bank and allow for reassessment.    Community and Support  If you are adopting this text in your class, please fill out this short form so we can track usage, let you know about updates, etc.  Implementation of these materials is supported by a TBIL community of practice which offers both formal and informal professional devlopmentopportunities. The best way to connect with us is on our Slack workspace .  These materials are a product of our TBIL community. Feedback and suggestions for improvements are most welcome, either through our GitHub Repository or the Slack workspace .   "

  "title": "Applications of Linear Equations (EQ2)",
  "body": " Applications of Linear Equations (EQ2)     Solve application problems involving linear equations.      Activities    Linear equations can be used to solve many types of real-world applications. We'll investigate some of those in this section.     Distance, rate, and time problems are a standard example of an application of a linear equation. For these, it's important to remember that where is distance, is the rate (or speed), and is time.  Often we will have more than one moving object, so it is helpful to denote which object's distance, rate, or time we are referring to. One way we can do this is by using a subscript. For example, if we are describing an eastbound train (as we will in the first example), it may be helpful to denote its distance, rate, and time as , , and respectively. Notice that the subscript is a label reminding us that we are referring to the eastbound train.     Two trains leave a station at the same time. One is heading east at a speed of mph, while the other is heading west at a speed of mph. After how long will the trains be miles apart?    How fast is each train traveling?  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph     B    Which of the statements describes how the times of the eastbound and westbound train are related?  The eastbound train is slower than the westbound train, so .  The eastbound train left an hour before the westbound train, so if we let , then .  Both trains have been traveling the same amount of time, so . Since they are the same, we can just call them both .  We don't know how the times relate to each other, so we must denote them separately as and .  Since the trains are traveling at different speeds, we need the proportion .     C    Fill in the following table using the information you've just determined about the trains' rates and times since they left the station. Some values are there to help you get started.     rate  time  distance from station    eastbound train        westbound train                rate  time  distance from station    eastbound train           westbound train              At the moment in question, the trains are miles apart. How does that total distance relate to the distance each train has traveled?  The miles is irrelevant. They've been traveling the same amount of time so they must be the same distance away from the station. That tells us .  The miles is the difference between the distance each train traveled, so .  The miles represents the sum of the distances that each train has traveled, so .  The miles is the product of the distance each train traveled, so .     C    Now plug in the expressions from your table for and . What equation do you get?                 C    Notice that we now have a linear equation in one variable, . Solve for , and put that answer in context of the problem.  The trains are miles apart after hours.  The trains are miles apart after hours.  The trains are miles apart after hours.  The trains are miles apart after hours.  The trains are miles apart after hours.     B    In , we examined the motion of two objects moving at the same time in opposite directions. In , we will examine a different perspective, but still apply to solve.    Jalen needs groceries, so decides to ride his bike to the store. It takes him half an hour to get there. After finishing his shopping, he sees his friend Alex who offers him a ride home. He takes the same route home as he did to the store, but this time it only takes one-fifth of an hour. If his average speed was mph faster on the way home, how far away does Jalen live from the grocery store?  We'll use the subscript to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip to the store while riding his ike and the subscript to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip home while riding in his friend's ar.    How long does his bike trip from home to the store and his car trip from the store back home take?  hours, hours  of an hour, of an hour  of an hour, of an hour  hours, hours  hours, hours     C    Which of the statements describes how the speed (rate) of the bike trip and the car trip are related?  Both the trip to the store and the trip home covered the same distance, so . Since they are the same, we can just call them both .  We don't know how the two rates relate to each other, so cannot write an equation comparing them and must leave them as separate variables and .  Jalen's rate on the trip home in the car was mph faster than his trip to the store on his bike, so if we let , then .  Jalen's rate on the trip home in the car was mph faster than his trip to the store on his bike, so if we let , then .     D    Fill in the following table using the information you've just determined about the Jalen's rates and times on each leg of his grocery store trip. Then fill in the distance column based on how distance relates to rate and time in each case.     rate  time  distance covered    bike trip (to the store)    car trip (going back home)           rate  time  distance covered    bike trip (to the store)       car trip (going back home)          Our goal is to figure out how far away Jalen lives from the store. To help us get there, write an equation relating and .  The distance he traveled by bike is the same as the distance he traveled by car, so .  The distance he traveled by bike took longer than the distance he traveled by car, so .  The distance, , between his house and the grocery store is sum of the distance he traveled on his bike and the distance he traveled in the car, so .  The distance, , between his house and the grocery store is sum of the difference he traveled on his bike and the distance he traveled in the car, so .     A    Now plug in the expressions from your table for and into the equation you just found. Notice that it is a linear equation in one variable, . Solve for .        Our goal was to determine the distance between Jalen's house and the grocery store. Solving for did not tell us that distance, but it did get us one step closer. Use that value to help you determine the distance between his house and the store, and write your answer using the context of the problem.  The grocery store is miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is miles away from Jalen's house.     Can you find an expression involving that we made that represents that distance?   A    Another type of application of linear equations is called a mixture problem. In these we will mix together two things, like two types of candy in a candy store or two solutions of different concentrations of alcohol.    Ammie's favorite snack to share with friends is candy salad, which is a mixture of different types of candy. Today she chooses to mix Nerds Gummy Clusters, which cost per pound, and Starburst Jelly Beans, which cost per pound. If she makes seven pounds of candy salad and spends a total of , how many pounds of each candy did she buy?    There are two \"totals\" in this situation: the total weight (in pounds) of candy Ammie bought and the total amount of money (in dollars) Ammie spent. Let's begin with the total weight. If we let represent the pounds of Nerds Gummy Clusters and represent the pounds of Starburst Jelly Beans, which of the following equations can represent the total weight?         C    Which expressions represent the amount she spent on each candy? Again, we will let represent the pounds of Nerds Gummy Clusters and represent the pounds of Starburst Jelly Beans.  spent on Nerds Gummy Clusters; spent on Starburst Jelly Beans  spent on Nerds Gummy Clusters; spent on Starburst Jelly Beans  spent on Nerds Gummy Clusters; spent on Starburst Jelly Beans  spent on Nerds Gummy Clusters; spent on Starburst Jelly Beans     B    Now we focus on the total cost. Which of the following equations can represent the total amount she spent?         B    We are almost ready to solve, but we have two variables in our weight equation and our cost equation. We will get the cost equation to one variable by using the weight equation as a substitution. Which of the following is a way to express one variable in terms of the other?  If is the total weight of the Nerds Gummy Clusters, then could represent the weight of the Starburst Jelly Beans.  If is the total weight of the Nerds Gummy Clusters, then could represent the weight of the Starburst Jelly Beans.  If is the total weight of the Starburst Jelly Beans, then could represent the weight of the Nerds Gummy Clusters.  If is the total weight of the Starburst Jelly Beans, then could represent the weight of the Nerds Gummy Clusters.     More than one answer may be correct here!   A or C    Plug your expressions in to the total cost equation.         More than one of these may be correct!   A or D, depending on the substitution chosen.    Now solve for and , and put your answer in the context of the problem.  Ammie bought lbs of Nerds Gummy Clusters and lbs of Starburst Jelly Beans.  Ammie bought lbs of Nerds Gummy Clusters and lbs of Starburst Jelly Beans.  Ammie bought lbs of Nerds Gummy Clusters and lbs of Starburst Jelly Beans.  Ammie bought lbs of Nerds Gummy Clusters and lbs of Starburst Jelly Beans.     C      A chemist needs to mix two solutions to create a mixture consisting of alcohol. She uses liters of the first solution, which has a concentration of alcohol. How many liters of the second solution (that is alcohol) should she add to the first solution to create the mixture that is alcohol?     liters      Exercises available at .    "

  "body": " Quadratic Equations (EQ5)     Solve quadratic equations using factoring, the square root property, completing the square, and the quadratic formula and express these answers in exact form.      Activities    A quadratic equation is of the form: where and are coefficients (and  ), is the variable, and is the constant term.      Before beginning to solve quadratic equations, we need to be able to identify all various forms of quadratics.   Which of the following is a quadratic equation?                  A, B, D, and E      To solve a quadratic equation, we will need to apply the zero product property , which states that if , then either or . In other words, you can only have a product of if one (or both!) of the factors is .      In this activity, we will look at how to apply the zero product property when solving quadratic equations.    Which of the following equations can you apply as your first step in solving?            B and D    Suppose you are given the quadratic equation, . Applying would give you:      and    and   C    After applying the zero product property, what are the solutions to the quadratic equation ?   and    and    and   and   D     Notice in and , that not all equations are set up \"nicely.\" You will need to do some manipulation to get everything on one side (AND in factored form!) and on the other *before* applying the zero product property.     Suppose you want to solve the equation , which is NOT in factored form.    Which of the following is the correct factored form of ?            D    After applying , which of the following will be a solution to ?   and    and    and   and   D      Solve each of the following quadratic equations:       and        and        and        and       Suppose you are given the equation, :    How many solutions does this equation have?                C    What are the solutions to this equation?                D    How is this quadratic equation different than the equations we've solved thus far?   When solving for , we have to consider both the positive and negative values.      The square root property states that a quadratic equation of the form (where is a nonzero number) will give solutions and . In other words, if we have an equation with a perfect square on one side and a number on the other side, we can take the square root of both sides to solve the equation.       Suppose you are given the equation, :    What would be the first step in solving ?  Divide by on both sides  Subtract on both sides  Add on both sides  Multiply by on both sides    C    Isolate the term and apply to solve for .   To continue to isolate the term, the next step is to divide by and then take the square root of both sides.    What are the solution(s) to ?        B      Solve the following quadratic equations by applying the square root property ( ).              or       Recall that when you have a negative number under a square root, that gives an imaginary number .    or in simplified form:       Isolate the binomial first.               Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved by using the square root property. In the next few activities, we will learn two additional methods in solving quadratics.    Another method for solving a quadratic equation is known as completing the square . With this method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of an equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equal sign and a constant on the other side. We then apply the square root property. Note: A perfect square trinomial is a trinomial that can be factored into a binomial squared. For example, is a perfect square trinomial because it can be factored into or .       Let's work through an example together to solve . (Notice that the methods of factoring and the square root property do not work with this equation.)    In order to apply , we first need to have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equal sign. Which of the following number(s) could we add to the left side of the equation to create a perfect square trinomial?        B    Add your answer from part to the right side of the equation as well (i.e. whatever you do to one side of an equation you must do to the other side too!) and then factor the perfect square trinomial on the left side. Which equation best represents the equation now?        C    Apply the square root property ( ) to both sides of the equation to determine the solution(s). Which of the following is the solution(s) of ?  and  and  and  and    B     To complete the square, the leading coefficient, (i.e., the coefficient of the term), must equal . If it does not, then factor the entire equation by and then follow similar steps as in .     Let's solve the equation by completing the square.    Rewrite the equation so that all the terms with the variable is on one side of the equation and a constant is on the other.        Notice that the coefficient of the term is not . What could we factor the left side of the equation by so that the coefficient of the is ?   Factor the left side by .    Once you factor the left side, what equation represents the equation you now have?        C    Just like in , let's now try and create the perfect square trinomial (inside the parentheses) on the left side of the equation. Which of the following number(s) could we add to the left side of the equation to create a perfect square trinomial?        A    What would we need to add to the right-hand side of the equation to keep the equation balanced?        B. Students may need help understanding that adding to the right-hand side of the equation does not keep the equation balanced.    Which of the following equation represents the quadratic equation you have now?        C    Apply the square root property and solve the quadratic equation.          Solve the following quadratic equations by completing the square.                         The last method for solving quadratic equations is the quadratic formula - a formula that will solve all quadratic equations! A quadratic equation of the form can be solved by the quadratic formula: where , , and are real numbers and .     Use the quadratic formula ( ) to solve .    When written in standard form, what are the values of , , and ?    and     When applying the quadratic formula, what would you get when you substitute , , and ?        A    What is the solution(s) to ?        C      Use the quadratic formula ( ) to solve .

When written in standard form, what are the values of , , and ?    and     When applying the quadratic formula, what would you get when you substitute , , and ?        B    Notice that the number under the square root is a negative. Recall that when you have a negative number under a square root, that gives an imaginary number . What is the solution(s) to ?  and  and  and  and    A      Solve the following quadratic equations by applying the quadratic formula ( ).

Activities    An algebraic expression is called a rational expression rational expression if it can be written as the ratio of two polynomials, and .  An equation is called a rational equation rational equation if it consists of only rational expressions and constants.      Technically, linear and quadratic equations are also rational equations. They are a special case where the denominator of the rational expressions is . We will focus in this section on cases where the denominator is not a constant; that is, rational equations where there are variables in the denominator.  With variables in the denominator, there will often be values that cause the denominator to be zero. This is a problem because division by zero is undefined. Thus, we need to be sure to exclude any values that would make those denominators equal to zero.      Which value(s) should be excluded as possible solutions to the following rational equations?

No solution       demonstrates why it is so important to determine excluded values and check our answers when solving rational equations.

  "body": " Introduction to Functions (FN1)     Determine if a relation, equation, or graph defines a function using the definition as well as the vertical line test.      Activities    A relation  function relation is a relationship between sets of values. Relations in mathematics are usually represented as ordered pairs: (input, output) or . When observing relations, we often refer to the -values as the domain and the -values as the range .       Mapping Notation  function mapping notation (also known as an arrow diagram) is a way to show relationships visually between sets. For example, suppose you are given the following ordered pairs: , and . Each of the -values \"map onto\" a -value and can be visualized in the following way:    Every -value from the ordered pair list is listed in the input set and every -value is listed in the output set. An arrow is drawn from every -value to its corresponding -value.   Notice that an arrow is used to indicate which -value is mapped onto its corresponding -value.      Use mapping notation to create a visual representation of the following relation.     What is the domain?  { }  { }  { }   B    What is the range?  { }  { }  { }   A      Use mapping notation to create a visual representation of the following relation.     What is the domain?  { }  { }  { }  { }   A    What is the range?  { }  { }  { }  { }   D      Use mapping notation to create a visual representation of the following relation.     What is the domain?  { }  { }  { }  { }   C    What is the range?  { }  { }  { }  { }   D    Notice that in , , and , each set represents a very different relationship. Many concepts in mathematics will depend on particular relationships, so it is important to be able to visualize relationships and compare them.    A function is a relation where every input (or -value) is mapped onto exactly one output (or -value).  Note that all functions are relations but not all relations are functions!      Relations can be expressed in multiple ways (ordered pairs, tables, and verbal descriptions).    Let's revisit some of the sets of ordered pairs we've previously explored in , , and . Which of the following sets of ordered pairs represent a function?                A and C    Note that relations can be expressed in a table. A table of values is shown below. Is this an example of a function? Why or why not?                             This relation is not a function. The -value, , has two outputs.    Relations can also be expressed in words. Suppose you are looking at the amount of time you spend studying versus the grade you earn in your Algebra class. Is this an example of a function? Why or why not?   Yes, this is an example of a function.    Notice that when trying to determine if a relation is a function, we often have to rely on looking at the domain and range values. Thus, it is important to be able to idenfity the domain and range of any relation!    For each of the given functions, determine the domain and range.        Domain: { }; Range: { }        Domain: { }; Range: { }                             Domain: { }; Range: { }    The amount of time you spend studying versus the grade you earn in your Algebra class.   Domain: {time studying}; Range: {grade in Algebra class}     Determine whether each of the following relations is a function.         This relation is a function.          This relation IS NOT a function.          This relation is a function.    You probably noticed (in ) that when the graph has points that \"line up\" or are on top of each other, they have the same -values. When this occurs, this shows that the same -value has two different outputs ( -values) and that the relation is not a function.    The vertical line test is a method used to determine whether a relation on a graph is a function.  Start by drawing a vertical line anywhere on the graph and observe the number of times the relation on the graph intersects with the vertical line. If every possible vertical line intersects the graph at only one point, then the relation is a function. If, however, the graph of the relation intersects a vertical line more than once (anywhere on the graph), then the relation is not a function.      Use the vertical line test ( ) to determine whether each graph of a relation represents a function.        This graph does not pass the vertical line test and is therefore NOT a function.        This graph passes the vertical line test and is therefore a function.        This graph passes the vertical line test and is therefore a function.        This graph does not pass the vertical line test and is therefore NOT a function.      Let's explore how to determine whether an equation represents a function.    Suppose you are given the equation .  If , what kind of -values would you get for ?   Based on this information, do you think is a function?     If , could be or . Given that there are two outputs for a given , then is not a function.   Suppose you are given the equation .  If , what kind of -values would you get for ?   Based on this information, do you think is a function?     If , . For every input ( -value), there is exactly one output ( -value) so is a function.   Suppose you are given the equation .  If , what kind of -values would you get for ?   Based on this information, do you think is a function?     If , could be or . Given that there are two outputs for a given , then is not a function.   Suppose you are given the equation .  If , what kind of -values would you get for ?   Based on this information, do you think is a function?     If , . For every input ( -value), there is exactly one output ( -value) so is a function.   How can you look at an equation to determine whether or not it is a function?  Students may have different answers. Ideally, you want students to see that they can check whether a given relation is a function in more than one way. They can test values (as this activity did by leading them to plug in values) or by using the vertical line test on a graph.   Notice that shows that equations with a term generally do not define functions. This is because to solve for a squared variable, you must consider both positive and negative inputs. For example, both and .    It's important to be able to determine the domain of any equation, especially when thinking about functions. Answer the following questions given the equation .    What values of would give an error (if any)?               A and D    Based on this information, for what values of would the equation exist?                B and C    How can we represent the domain of this equation in interval notation?                B      Answer the following questions given the equation .    What values of would give an error (if any)?               None of the values will give an error.    Based on this information, for what values of would the equation exist?                A, B, C, and D    How can we represent the domain of this equation in interval notation?                D      Answer the following questions given the equation .

A, B, and C    How can we represent the domain of this equation in interval notation?            U     D    When determining the domain of an equation, it is often easier to first find values of that make the function undefined. Once you have those values, then you know that can be any value but those.    Exercises available at .    "

  "body": " Characteristics of a Function's Graph (FN3)     Use the graph of a function to find the domain and range in interval notation, the - and -intercepts, the maxima and minima, and where it is increasing and decreasing using interval notation.      Activities  In this section, we will be looking at different kinds of graphs and will identify various characteristics. These ideas can span all kinds of functions, so you will see these come up multiple times!    One of the easiest things to identify from a graph are the intercepts , which are points at which the graph crosses the axes. An -intercept is a point at which the graph crosses the -axis and a -intercept is a point at which the graph crosses the -axis. Because intercepts are points, they are typically written as an ordered pair: .      Use the following graphs to answer the questions.            What are the -intercept(s) of ?               C    What are the -intercept(s) of ?               B and C    What are the -intercept(s) of ?               D    What are the -intercept(s) of ?               A    Sketch a graph of a function with the following intercepts:   -intercepts: and    -intercept:      Answers will vary. Students should make sure that their sketch is a function.    Sketch a graph of a function with the following intercepts:   -intercept:    -intercept: and      You could draw a variety of graphs, but they would not be functions.    Notice in , that a function can have multiple -intercepts, but only one -intercept. Having more than one -intercept would create a graph that is not a function!    The domain refers to the set of possible input values and the range refers to the set of possible output values. If given a graph, however, it would be impossible to list out all the values for the domain and range so we use interval notation to represent the set of values.    Recall that the terms domain and range were first introduced in .      Use the following graph to answer the questions below.         Draw on the -axis all the values in the domain.   Students should shade all values of from to . The intent here is to help students visualize that the domain consists of more than -values that are integers.    What interval represents the domain you drew in part (a)?               B    Draw on the -axis all the values in the range.   Students should shade all values of from to . The intent here is to help students visualize that the range consists of more than -values that are integers.    What interval represents the range you drew in part (c)?               C      Use the following graph to answer the questions below.         What is the domain of this graph?               D    What is the range of this graph?               C    When writing your intervals for domain and range, notice that you will need to write them from the smallest values to the highest values. For example, we wouldn't write as an interval because is smaller than . For domain, read the graph from left to right. For range, read the graph from bottom to top.     Use the following graph to answer the questions below.         What is the domain of this graph?               A    What is the range of this graph?               C      Use the following graph to answer the questions below.         What is the domain of this graph?               D    What is the range of this graph?               C    Notice that finding the domain and range can be tricky! Be sure to pay attention to the - and -values of the entire graph - not just the endpoints!    In this activity, we will look at where the function is increasing and decreasing. Use the following graph to answer the questions below.       Where do you think the graph is increasing?   The function is increasing from . Instructors can emphasize this by having students think about where the function is \"going up.\" It may be helpful to also note that the function is no longer \"going up\" once you get to the \"top\". This could help students think about how to write their answer in interval notation (with parentheses and not brackets).    Which interval best represents where the function is increasing?               B    Where do you think the graph is decreasing?   The function is decreasing from . Instructors can emphasize this by having students think about where the function is \"going down.\" It may be helpful to also note that the function is no longer \"going down\" once you get to the \"bottom\". In this case, the \"bottom\" does not exist...This might be a good opportunity to discuss with students how to address this when writing the range in interval notation.    Which interval best represents where the function is decreasing?               C    Based on what you see on the graph, do you think this graph has any maxima or minima?   The intent here is for students to visually see there that the graph reaches a high point (i.e., the maximum). To extend this thinking, instructors could also ask students to draw a sketch (or discuss) when a graph would have a minimum.      As you noticed in , functions can increase or decrease (or even remain constant!) for a period of time. The interval of increase is when the -values of the function increase as the -values increase. The interval of decrease is when the -values of the function decrease as the -values increase. The function is constant when the -values remain constant as -values increase (also known as the constant interval ).  The easiest way to identify these intervals is to read the graph from left to right and look at what is happening to the -values.      The maximum , or global maximum , of a graph is the point where the -coordinate has the largest value. The minimum , or global minimum is the point on the graph where the -coordinate has the smallest value.  Graphs can also have local maximums and local minimums . A local maximum point is a point where the function value (i.e, -value) is larger than all others in some neighborhood around the point. Similarly, a local minimum point is a point where the function value (i.e, -value) is smaller than all others in some neighborhood around the point.     Global extrema are sometimes referred to as absolute extrema, while local extrema are sometimes referred to as relative extrema.     Use the following graph to answer the questions below.         At what value of is there a global maximum?               D    What is the global maximum value?               A    At what value of is there a global minimum?               C    What is the global minimum value?               D    At approximately what value of is there a local maximum?               B    What is the local maximum value?               B    At approximately what value of is there a local minimum?               C    What is the local minimum value?               D    Notice that in , there are two ways we talk about max and min. We might want to know the location of where the max or min are (i.e., determining at which -value the max or min occurs at) or we might want to know what the max or min values are (i.e., the -value). Also, note that in , a local minimum is also a global minimum.     Sometimes, it is not always clear what the maxima or minima are or if they exist.

  "body": " Finding the Inverse Function (FN6)     Find the inverse of a one-to-one function.      Activities  A function is a process that converts a collection of inputs to a corresponding collection of outputs. One question we can ask is: for a particular function, can we reverse the process and think of the original function's outputs as the inputs?    Temperature can be measured using many different units such as Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Fahrenheit is what is usually reported on the news each night in the United States, while Celsius is commonly used for scientific work. We will begin by converting between these two units. To convert from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius use the following formula.     Room temperature is around degrees Fahrenheit. Use the above equation to convert this temperature to Celsius.             B    Solve the equation for in terms of .                D    Alternatively, degrees Celsius is a fairly comfortable temperature. Use your solution for in terms of to convert this temperature to Fahrenheit.             D    Notice that when you converted degrees Fahrenheit, you got a value of degrees Celsius. Alternatively, when you converted degrees Celsius, you got degrees Fahrenheit. This indicates that the equation you were given for and the equation you found for are inverses.    Let be a function. If there exists a function such that for all , then we say has an inverse function , or that is the inverse of  . When a given function has an inverse function, we usually denote it as , which is read as \" inverse\".    An inverse is a function that \"undoes\" another function. For any input in the domain, the function will reverse the process of .    It is important to note that in we say \"if there exists a function,\" but we don't guarantee that this is always the case. How can we determine whether a function has a corresponding inverse or not? Consider the following two functions and represented by the tables.                                                                                Use the definition of in to find an such that .               C    Is it possible to reverse the input and output rows of the function and have the new table result in a function?   Yes. If you reverse the input and output values, you will see that every input goes to exactly one output (which defines a function).    Use the definition of in to find an such that .               B and D    Is it possible to reverse the input and output rows of the function and have the new table result in a function?   If you reverse the input and output values, the resulting table is NOT a function. This is because the new input will be mapping onto two -values ( and ).    Some functions, like in , have a given output value that corresponds to two or more input values: and . If we attempt to reverse the process of this function, we have a situation where the new input would correspond to two potential outputs.    A one-to-one function is a function in which each output value corresponds to exactly one input.    A function must be one-to-one in order to have an inverse.    Consider the function .    When you evaluate this expression for a given input value of , what operations do you perform and in what order?  divide by , subtract  subtract , divide by  add , multiply by  multiply by , add     B    When you \"undo\" this expression to solve for a given ouput value of , what operations do you perform and in what order?  divide by , subtract  subtract , divide by  add , multiply by  multiply by , add     D    This set of operations reverses the process for the original function, so can be considered the inverse function. Write an equation to express the inverse function .             D    Check your answer to the previous question by finding and .   By completing this task, students should find that when they do the composition (in both directions), they will get an output of .      To find the inverse of a one-to-one function, perform the reverse operations in the opposite order.      Let's look at an alternate method for finding an inverse by solving the function for and then interchanging the and .     Interchange the variables and .             C    Eliminate the denominator.             D    Distribute and gather the terms together.             C    Write the inverse function, by factoring and solving for .             B      Find the inverse of each function, using either method. Check your answer using function composition.                  A                  D      Exercises available at .    "

Use the definition of in to find an such that .               C    Is it possible to reverse the input and output rows of the function and have the new table result in a function?   Yes. If you reverse the input and output values, you will see that every input goes to exactly one output (which defines a function).    Use the definition of in to find an such that .               B and D    Is it possible to reverse the input and output rows of the function and have the new table result in a function?   If you reverse the input and output values, the resulting table is NOT a function. This is because the new input will be mapping onto two -values ( and ).   "

  "body": " Slope and Average Rate of Change (LF1)     Determine the average rate of change of a given function over a given interval. Find the slope of a line.      Activities  This section will explore ideas around average rate of change and slope. To help us get started, let's take a look at a context in which these ideas can be helpful.    Robert came home one day after school to a very hot house! When he got home, the temperature on the thermostat indicated that it was degrees! Robert decided that was too hot for him, so he turned on the air conditioner. The table of values below indicate the temperature of his house after turning on the air conditioner.    Time (minutes)  Temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)                                    How much did the temperature change from to minutes?  The temperature decreased by degrees  The temperature decreased by degrees  The temperature increased by degrees  The temperature increased by degrees >   B    How much did the temperature change from to minutes?  The temperature decreased by degrees  The temperature decreased by degrees  The temperature increased by degrees  The temperature increased by degrees >   B    If Robert wanted to know how much the temperature was decreasing each minute, how could he figure that out?   Choosing any two points that have a time difference of minute should show that the temperature decreases by degrees every minute.    How would you describe the overall behavior of the temperature of Robert's house?   Overall, the temperature of Robert's house is decreasing (the air conditioner appears to be working!). Notice that in parts (a) and (b), the temperature decreased degrees in minutes.    Notice in that the temperature appears to be decreasing at a constant rate (i.e., the temperature decreased degrees for every -minute interval). Upon further investigation, you might have also noticed that the temperature decreased by degrees every minute.    Refer back to the data Robert collected of the temperature of his house after turning on the air conditioner ( ).    If this pattern continues, what will the temperature be after minutes?        D    If this pattern continues, how long will it take for Robert's house to reach degrees?  minutes  minutes  minutes  minutes    C    An average rate of change helps us to see and understand how a function is generally behaving. For example, in and , we began to see how the temperature of Robert’s house was decreasing every minute the air conditioner was on. In other words, when looking at average rate of change, we are comparing how one quantity is changing with respect to something else changing.    An average rate of change of a function calculates the amount of change in one item divided by the corresponding amount of change in another.  To calculate the average rate of change for any function , we pick two points, and , and evaluate the function at those two points. We then find the difference between the -values and -values to calcuate the average rate of change:  Recall that we can use function notation to describe - and -values. , for instance represents the -value when plugging in a value for (or ).   .      Use the table below to answer the questions.                                Applying , what is the average rate of change when to ?        C    What is the average rate of change on the interval ?        A    Does this function have a constant average rate of change?   No. This would be a great opportunity for students to make observations of the average rate of change across different intervals.      Use the graph to calculate the average rate of change on the given intervals.       Applying , what is the average rate of change on the interval ?        B    What is the average rate of change on the interval ?        A      Just like with tables and graphs, you should be able to find the average rate of change when given a function. For this activity, use the function to answer the following questions.    Applying , what is the average rate of change on the interval ?        B    What is the average rate of change on the interval ?        D      Use the given graph of the function, , to investigate the average rate of change of a linear function.       What is the average rate of change on the interval ?        B    What is the average rate of change on the interval ? Notice that you cannot see the point at . How could you use the equation of the line to determine the -value when ?        A    Based on your observations in parts (a) and (b), what do you think will be the average rate of change on the interval ?   The average rate of change is . Based on the previous parts, it shows that the average rate of change does not change for this function.    Notice in , the average rate of change was the same regardless of which interval you were given. But in , the average rate of change was not the same across different intervals.    The slope of a line has a constant that represents the direction and steepness of the line. For a linear function, the slope never changes - meaning it has a constant average rate of change.      The steepness of a line depends on the vertical and horizontal distances between two points on the line. Use the graph below to compare the steepness, or slope, of the two lines.       What is the vertical distance between the two points on the red line?        C    What is the horizontal distance between the two points on the red line?        A    Using information from parts (a) and (b), what value could we use to describe the steepness of the red line?        B. This could be a good place to discuss where comes from (change of over the change in ).    What is the vertical distance between the two points on the blue line?        A    What is the horizontal distance between the two points on the blue line?        B    Using information from parts (d) and (e), what value could we use to describe the steepness of the blue line?        D. This could be a good place to discuss where comes from (change of over the change in ).    Which line is the steepest?   The red line. The slope of the red line is and the slope of the blue line is . Because is larger than , the red line is steeper.    The steepness, or slope, of a line can be found by the change in (the vertical distance between two points on the line) divided by the change in (the horizontal distance between two points on the line). Slope can be calculated as \"rise over run.\" Slope is a way to describe the steepness of a line. The red line in has a larger value for it's slope than the blue line. Thus, the red line is steeper than the blue line.     Now that we know how to find the slope (or steepness) of a line, let's look at other properties of slope. Use the graph below to answer the following questions.       What is the slope of the blue line?        A    What is the slope of the green line?        C    How are the slopes of the lines similar?   Students will probably notice that both slopes have the same steepness .    How are the slopes of the lines different?   Although both slopes have the same steepness , one line has a positive slope (blue line) and the other line has a negative slope (green line).    Notice in that the slope does not just indicate how steep a line is, but also it's direction. A negative slope indicates that the line is decreasing (from left to right) and a positive slope indicates that the line is increasing (from left to right).    Suppose and are two points on a line.    Plot these points on a graph and find the slope by using \"rise over run.\"        C    Now calculate the slope by using the change in over the change in .        C    What do you notice about the slopes you got in parts (a) and (b)?   Students should notice that they get the same answer. Both methods can be used to find the slope.    We can calculate slope ( ) by finding the change in and dividing by the change in . Mathematically, this means that when given and , .    Calculate the slope of each representation of a line using the slope formula.                                              and    The slope is undefined.    In , there were slopes that were and undefined. When a line is vertical, the slope is undefined. This means that there is only a vertical distance between two points and there is no horizontal distance. When a line is horizontal, the slope is . This means that the line never rises vertically, giving a vertical distance of zero.    Exercises available at .    "

  "body": " Systems of Linear Equations (LF6)     Solve a system of two linear equations in two variables.      Activities    Often times when solving a real-world application, more than one equation is necessary to describe the information. We'll investigate some of those in this section.      Admission into a carnival for children and adults is . For children and adults, the admission is . Assuming a different price for children and adults, what is the price of the child's admission and the price of the adult admission?    Let represent the cost of a child's admission and the cost of an adult admission. Write an equation to represent the total cost for children and adults.                   C    Now write an equation to represent the total cost for children and adults.                   A    Using the above equations, check by substitution which admission prices would satisfy both equations?     and    and    and    and      B      A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations made up of two or more variables. A solution to a system of equations is a value for each of the variables that satisfies all the equations at the same time.      Consider the following system of equations.   Which of the ordered pairs is a solution to the system?                D    While we can test points to determine if they are solutions, it is not feasible to test every possible point to find a solution. We need a method to solve a system.    Consider the following system of equations.     Rewrite the first equation in terms of .        Rewrite the second equation in terms of .        Graph the two equations on the same set of axes. Where do the lines intersect?       The point of intersection is .   Check that the point of intersection of the two lines is a solution to the system of equations.   To check to see if the point of intersection is a solution, plug in in for and in for into BOTH equations.    Sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact intersection point of two lines using a graph. Let's explore another possible method for solving a system of equations.    Consider the following system of equations.     Graph the two equations on the same set of axes. Is it possible to determine exactly where the lines intersect?       The point of intersection is not at a \"nice\" point, making it hard to see exactly where it is.   Solve the first equation for and substitute into the second equation. What is the resulting equation?               B    Solve the resulting equation from part (b) for .               B    Substitute the value of into the first equation to find the value of .               B    Write the solution to the system of equations (the found values of and ) as an ordered pair.        This method of solving a system of equations is referred to as the Substitution Method .   Solve one of the equations for one variable.    Substitute the expression into the other equation to solve for the remaining variable.    Substitute that value into either equation to find the value of the first variable.       Solve the following system of equations using the substitution method.          While the substitution method will always work, sometimes the resulting equations will be difficult to solve. Let's explore a third method for solving a system of two linear equations with two variables.    Consider the following system of equations.     Add the two equations together. What is the resulting equation?               D    Use the resulting equation after addition, to solve for the variable.               D    Use the value to find the solution to the system of equations.        This method of solving a system of equations is referred to as the Elimination Method .   Combine the two equations using addition or subtraction to eliminate one of the variables.    Solve the resulting equation.    Substitute that value into either equation to find the value of the other variable.       Solve the following system of equations using the elimination method.            Consider the following system of equations. Notice that if you simply add the two equations together, it will not eliminate a variable.

Activities  Quadratic functions have many different applications in the real world. For example, say we want to identify a point at which the maximum profit or minimum cost occurs. Before we can interpret some of these situations, however, we will first need to understand how to read the graphs of quadratic functions to locate these least and greatest values.    Use the graph of the quadratic function to answer the questions below.    Quadratic function that opens upward       Make a table for values of corresponding to the given -values.

The maximum value appears to occur near .  There is no maximum value of this function.     D      The point at which a quadratic function has a maximum or minimum value is called the vertex . The vertex form  quadratic function vertex form of a quadratic function is given by , where is the vertex  quadratic function vertex from vertex form of the parabola.      The axis of symmetry quadratic function axis of symmetry , also known as the line of symmetry, is the line that makes the shape of an object symmetrical. For a quadratic function, the axis of symmetry always passes through the vertex and so is the vertical line .

The standard form  quadratic function standard form of a quadratic function is given by , where , and are real coefficients.      Just as with the vertex form of a quadratic, we can use the standard form of a quadratic to find the axis of symmetry  quadratic function axis of symmetry and the vertex  quadratic function vertex from standard form by using the values of , and . Given the standard form of a quadratic, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line and the vertex is at the point .      Use the graph of the quadratic function to answer the questions below.    Quadratic function that opens downward with vertex (-1,4)       Which of the following quadratic functions could be the graph shown in the figure?               B or C because they both have a negative in the front, which would indicate that the graph is pointing downward.    What is the maximum or minimum value?               B. Instructors might need to distinguish what a max or min value is versus where the max or min value is located.      Consider the following four graphs of quadratic functions:                      Which of the graphs above have a maximum?

A function has a maximum value at and its axis of symmetry at .    Sketch a graph of a function that meets the criteria for .   Note that this is just one possible sketch students might draw.   A sketch of one possible quadratic that fits the criteria        Was your graph the only possible answer? Try to sketch another graph that meets this criteria.   No. There are many possible graphs students could sketch (think vertical shift along the axis of symmetry).      Other points, such as - and -intercepts, may be helpful in sketching a more accurate graph of a quadratic function.      Consider the following two quadratic functions and and answer the following questions:    Applying , what is the vertex and axis of symmetry of ?   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:    D    Applying , what is the vertex and axis of symmetry of ?   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:   vertex: ; axis of symmetry:    D    What do you notice about and ?   They have the same vertex and axis of symmetry.    Now graph both and and draw a sketch of each graph on one coordinate plane. How are they similar\/different?

What other characteristics would be useful to help us draw an accurate sketch of ?  Answers may include, -intercepts, end behaviour, max and min      The end behavior  polynomial function end behavior of a polynomial function describes the behavior of the graph at the \"ends\" of the function. In other words, as we move to the right of the graph (as the values increase), what happens to the values? Similarly, as we move to the left of the graph (as the values decrease), what happens to the values?   Although we are looking at the \"ends\" to determine the end behavior, note that polynomials do not actually have ends. In other words, polynomial functions have -values that exist for every -value.      Use the graphs of the following polynomial functions to answer the questions below.                     How would you describe the behavior of Graph A as you approach the ends?  Graph A rises on the left and on the right.  Graph A rises on the left, but falls on the right.

Graph D rises on the left and on the right.  Graph D rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph D rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph D falls on the left and on the right.   D      Typically, when given an equation of a polynomial function, we look at the degree and leading coefficient to help us determine the behavior of the ends. The degree is the highest exponential power in the polynomial. The leading coefficient is the number written in front of the variable with the highest exponential power.     Let's refer back to the graphs in and look at the equations of those polynomial functions. Let's apply to see if we can determine how the degree and leading coefficients of those graphs affect their end behavior.

What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?   Even degree go the same way    Notice that Graph B and Graph C have their ends going in opposite directions. What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?   Odd degree go the opposite direction      From , we saw that the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial function can give us more clues about the behavior of the function. In summary, we know: If the degree is even, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in the same direction. If the leading coefficient is positive, both ends will be pointing up. If the leading coefficient is negative, both ends will be pointing down.  If the degree is odd, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in opposite directions. If the leading coefficient is positive, the left end will fall and the right end will rise. If the leading coefficient is negative, the left end will rise and the right end will fall.       When describing end behavior, mathematicians typically use arrow notation . Just as the name suggests, arrows are used to indicate the behavior of certain values on a graph.  For end behavior, students are often asked to determine the behavior of -values as -values either increase or decrease. The statement \"As , \" can be translated to \"As approaches infinity (or as increases), (or the -values) go to negative infinity (i.e., it decreases).\"      Use the graph of to answer the questions below.    A polynomial function with one even and one odd multiplicity       How would you describe the end behavior of ?   rises on the left and on the right.   rises on the left, but falls on the right.   rises on the right, but falls on the left.   falls on the left and on the right.

At the graph touches the axis and turns around.      The multiplicity  polynomial function multiplicity of a polynomial function is the number of times a given factor appears in the factored form of the equation of a polynomial.  The zero, in has multiplicity because the factor occurs twice (the exponent is a ).      Use the function, to answer the following questions:   What are the zeros of ?              D   Using , determine the multiplicities of the zeros you found in part (a).   has multiplicity 2. has multiplicty 1.    Now graph and look at the zeros on the graph. What do you notice about the behavior of the graph at each zero?    touches the axis and turns around. crosses the axis.      Refer back to and . Notice that when the graph crosses the -axis at the zero, the mulitplicity of that zero is odd. When the graph touches the -axis at the zero, the multiplicity is even. In other words, factors of with odd exponents will cross the -axis and factors of with even exponents will touch the -axis.      When graphing polynomial functions, you may notice that these functions have some \"hills\" and \"valleys.\" These characteristics of the graph are known as the local maxima and local minima of the graph - similar to what we've already seen with quadratic functions. Unlike quadratic functions, however, a polynomial graph can have many local maxima\/minima (quadratic functions only have one).      Now that we know all the different characterisitics of polynomials, we should also be able to identify them from a graph. Use the graph below to find the given charactertistics.

Between and since the graph must touch the -axis at both places.    Now look at the graph of . At which zero does a local maximum or local minimum occur? Explain how you know.   At since the graph touches the axis and turns around.      We can estimate where these local maxima and minima occur by looking at other characteristics, such as multiplicities and end behavior.  From , we saw that when the function touches the -axis at a zero, then that zero could be either a local maximum or a local minimum of the graph. When the function crosses the -axis, however, the local maximum or local minimum occurs between the zeros.      Exercises available at .    "

Activities   In , we introduced the idea of an inverse function. The fundamental idea is that has an inverse function if and only if there exists another function such that and “undo” one another's respective processes. In other words, the process of the function is reversible, and reversing generates a related function .     Let be the function given by .    Fill in the table of values for .                                                                      Do you think P will have an inverse function? Why or why not?   Students may say, each input has a distinct output, the function is one-to-one.    Since has an inverse function, we know there exists some other function, say , such that represent the same relationship between and as . In words, this means that reverses the process of raising to the power of 10, telling us the power to which we need to raise 10 to produce a desired result. Fill in the table of values for .                                                                      What are the domain and range of ?   Domain Range     What are the domain and range of ?   Domain Range     The powers of 10 function has an inverse . This new function is called the base 10 logarithm. But, we could have done a similar procedure with any base, which leads to the following definition.    The base logarithm of a number is the exponent we must raise to get that number. We represent this function as .  We read the logarithmic expression as \"The logarithm with base of is equal to ,\" or \"log base of is .\"    We can use to express the relationship between logarithmic form and exponential form as follows: whenever     Write the following logarithmic equations in exponential form.

B                      C                      A      We can use the idea of converting a logarithm to an exponential to evaluate logarithms.    Consider the logarithm . If we want to evaluate this, which question should you try and solve?  To what exponent must be raised in order to get ?  What exponent must be raised to the third in order to get ?

The natural logarithm is a logarithm with base and has its own notation.  Recall the number was introduced in         Evaluate the following logarithms.

Activities  Recall that we can convert between exponential and logarithmic forms. is equivalent to     This activity will investigate ways we can solve logarithmic equations using properties and definitions from previous sections.    Given that , how can we rewrite this into an exponential equation?        C    Now that is rewritten as an exponential equation, what is the value of ?        B    Notice in , you were able to solve a logarithmic equation by converting it into an exponential equation. This is one method in solving logarithmic equations.    For each of the following, solve the logarithmic equations by first converting them to exponential equations.             C             B             D      Not all logarithmic equations can be solved by converting to exponential equations. In this activity, we will explore another way to solve logarithmic equations.    Suppose you are given the equation, , and you brought all the logs to one side to get . Using the quotient property of logs, how could you condense the left side of the equation?        A    Now that you have a single logarithm, convert this logarithmic form into exponential form. What does this new equation look like?        A and D    Notice that the \"log\" has disappeared and you now have an equation with just the variable . Which of the following is equivalent to the equation you got in part b?       A    Compare the answer you got in part c to the original equation given . What do you notice?   Students should notice that the equation they have thus far is , which is very similar to the original equation (only without the logs). Students may make a conjecture about \"dropping\" the logs to solve.    Solve the equation you got in part d to find the value of .        D    Notice in , that you did not have to convert the logarithmic equation into an exponential equation. A faster method, when you have a log on both sides of the equals sign, is to \"drop\" the logs and set the arguments equal to one another. Be careful though - you can only have one log on each side before you can \"drop\" them!    The one-to-one property of logarithms states that if both sides of an equation can be rewritten as a single logarithm with the same base, then the arguments can be set equal to each other (and then solved algebraically).      Apply and other properties of logarithms (i.e., product, quotient, and power) to solve the following logarithmic equations.                           and          or       In some cases, you will get equations with logs of different bases. Apply properties of logarithms to solve the following logarithmic equations.        Use the change of base formula to rewrite so that it has a base of .             and       Now that we've looked at how to solve logarithmic equations, let's see how we can apply similar methods to solving exponential equations.    Suppose you are given the equation . There is no whole number value we can raise to to get . What two whole numbers must be between?   Between and .    We'll use logarithms to isolate the variable in the exponent. How can we convert into a logarithmic equation?        B    Notice that the answer you got in part b is an exact answer for . There will be times, though, that it will be helpful to also have an approximation for . Which of the following is a good approximation for ?        A    Notice in we started with an exponential equation and then solved by converting the equation into a logarithmic equation. Logarithms can help us get the variable out of the exponent.    Although rewriting an exponential equation into a logarithmic equation is helpful at times, it is not the only method in solving exponential equations. In this activity, we will explore what happens when we take the log of both sides of an exponential equation and use the properties of logarithms to solve in another way.    Suppose you are given the equation: . Take the log of both sides. What equation do you now have?        Apply the power property of logarithms ( ) to bring down the exponent. What equation do you now have?        Solve for . What does equal?        Using the change-of-base formula ( ), rewrite your answer from part c so that is written as a single logarithm. What is the exact value of ?        If you were to solve by converting it into a logarithmic equation, what would it look like?        What do you notice about your answer from parts d and e?   Students should see that the two answers they got for parts d and e are the same. This might be a good time to discuss why taking the log of both sides is a valid method in solving an exponential equation.      Use the method of taking the log of both sides (as you saw in ) to solve .    Take the log of both sides and use the power property of logarithms to bring down the exponent. What equation do you have now?        C    Solve for .        A    What is the approximate value of ?        A      In this activity, we will explore other types of exponential equations, which will require other methods of solving.    Suppose you are given the equation and you decide to take the log of both sides as your first step to get What would you use next to solve this equation?  Quotient property of logarithms  Power property of logarithms  Product property of logarithms  Change of base formula  One-to-one property of logarithms    B    Applying the property you chose in part a, what would the resulting equation be?        B and D    Now that you have a logarithmic equation, divide both sides by to begin to isolate the variable . After dividing by , what equation do you now have?        B    Compare the equation you got in part c to the original equation given. What do you notice?   Students will probably notice that their resulting equation are just the exponents of the original equation set equal to one another.    Solve for .        D    Notice in , it is much faster to set the exponents equal to one another. Make sure to check that the bases are equal before you set the exponents equal! And if the bases are not equal, you might have to use properties of exponents to help you get the bases to be the same.    When you are given an exponential equation with the same bases on both sides, you can simply set the exponents equal to one another and solve. This is known as the one-to-one property of exponentials .      When an exponential equation has the same base on each side, the exponents can be set equal to one another. If the bases aren't the same, we can rewrite them using properties of exponents and use the one-to-one property of exponentials.

A coffee is sitting on Mr. Abacus's desk cooling. It cools according to the function , where is the time elapsed in minutes and is the temperature in degrees Celsius.  Newton's Law of Heating and Cooling states that the temperature of a body changes at a rate proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings. In this case, we will be oberving what happens to the temperature of Mr. Abacus's coffee as it's temperature adjusts to its surroundings.    What is the initial temperature of Mr. Abacus's coffee?        D    What is the temperature of Mr. Abacus's coffee after minutes?        C    According to the function given, if Mr. Abacus leaves his coffee on his desk all day, what will the coffee eventually cool to?       Think about what happens to the function as .  C      A video posted on YouTube initially had views as soon as it was posted.

By , the population had grown to deer. The population was growing exponentially. Recall that the general form of an exponential equation is , where is the initial value, is the growth\/decay factor, and is time. We want to write a function to represent the deer population after years.    What is the initial value for the deer population?    deer    We are not given the growth factor, so we must solve for it. Write an exponential equation using the initial population, the population, and the time elapsed.        Take your equation in part b and solve for using logs.    is approximately     Now that you have found the growth factor (from part b), what is the equation, in terms of and that represents the deer population?        If the growth continues according to this exponential function, when will the population reach ?   It will take years, which means the deer population will reach in the year .      The concentration of salt in ocean water, called salinity, varies as you go deeper in the ocean. Suppose models salinity of ocean water to depths of meters at a certain latitude, where is the depth in meters and is in grams of salt per kilogram of seawater. (Note that salinity is expressed in the unit g\/kg, which is often written as ppt (part per thousand) or ‰ (permil).)

Round to the nearest tenth.  cycles per second  cycles per second  cycles per second  cycles per second    C    Another application of exponential equations is compound interest. Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account. Compound interest can be calcuated by using the formula , where is the account value, is measured in years, is the starting amount of the account (also known as the principal), is the annual percentage rate (APR) written as a decimal, and is the number of compounding periods in one year.     Before we can apply the compound interest formula, we need to understand what \"compounding\" means. Recall that compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account. This amount is calculated a certain number of times in a given year.    Suppose an account is compounded quarterly, what value of would we use in the formula?         C    Suppose an account is compounded daily, what value of would we use in the formula?         E    Suppose an account is compounded semi-annually, what value of would we use in the formula?         B    Suppose an account is compounded monthly, what value of would we use in the formula?         D    Suppose an account is compounded annually, what value of would we use in the formula?

B    Mr. Smith invested in a savings account that earns interest compounded annually. He made no additional deposits or withdrawals. Which expression can be used to determine the number of dollars in this account at the end of years?        A      Suppose you want to invest in a banking account that has a interest rate. Let's investigate what would happen to the amount of money you have at the end of one year in the account with varying compounding periods. Use the formula, , to help you solve the following problems.    Suppose the account is compounded annually (i.e., ). How much money would you have in the account at the end of the year?        By what factor did the money in your account grow in part a?   Because you initially started with and the account grew to by the end of the year, the account grew by (doubled), or by a factor of .    Suppose the account is compounded semi-annually. How much money would you have in the account at the end of the year?        By what factor did the money in your account grow in part b?   At the end of the year, you will have , which is in growth, or a factor of .    Let's investigate as the compounding periods increase. Fill in the following table.        Growth Factor                                                      Growth Factor                                                                                               What do you notice as the value of increases?   The growth factor seems to tend towards as the value of increases. In other words, as the interval gets smaller, the total returns get slightly higher. If interest is calculated times per year, at a rate of , the total accreted wealth at the end of the first year would be slightly greater than times the initial investment if is sufficiently large.    In , we can see that as the value of increases, the factor by which the money increased by tended toward the value of . This value is a significant mathematical constant and is denoted by the symbol . It is approximately equal to .  For many real-world phenomena, is used as the base for exponential functions. Exponential models that use as the base are called continuous growth or decay models. We see these models in finance, computer science, and most of the sciences, such as physics, toxicology, and fluid dynamics. For all real numbers , and all positive numbers and , continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula , where is the initial value, is the continuous growth rate per of unit time, and is the elapsed time. If , then the formula represents continuous growth. If , then the formula represents continuous decay.  For business applications, the continuous growth formula is called the continuous compounding formula and takes the form , where is the principal or the initial invested, is the growth or interest rate per of unit time, and is the period or term of the investment.     Use the continuous formulas to answer the following questions.    A person invested in an account earning per year compounded continuously. How much was in the account at the end of one year?        Radon-222 decays at a continuous rate of per day. How much will mg of Radon-222 decay to in days?    mg      Exercises available at .    "
