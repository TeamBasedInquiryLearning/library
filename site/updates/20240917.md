Dear TBIL Community,

All TBIL-trained community members are invited to participate in an NSF-funded **TBIL Community Workshop** to be held in Seattle, WA on 2025 January 7. Note that this is the day before the start of the [2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm), and we anticipate to hold our workshop in the conference hotel. This event is not affiliated with the JMM but we hope that many participants will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to extend their stay in Seattle and participate in the JMM as well.

For more details and to apply for funding, [visit this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx139r4B1pywuH-ZFf0cLZap_McCYxP-uePOaQKFSQI5_LDQ/viewform). Please apply by **2024 October 1** so we can make arrangements for this exciting event to bring together our community this January!
