                    Suppose a  bucket of water is being pulled into the air by a rope at a constant rate.  The bucket is constantly losing water as it's pulled up, so at a height of <m>h</m> meters, the mass of the bucket is <m>m(h)={{bucket}}</m> kg.  Find an integral which computes how much work is needed to lift the bucket <m>{{height}}</m> meters into the air.  Recall that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8 m<m>/\text{s}^2</m>.

                    Suppose a  well filled with water has height {{height}} meters and radius {{radius}} meters.  Find an integral which computes how much work is needed to pump all the water out of the well.  Recall that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8 m<m>/\text{s}^2</m> and the density of water is <m>1000\text{kg}/\text{m}^3</m>.
