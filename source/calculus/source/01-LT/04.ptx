        <p>
          When <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> exists but is not equal to <m>f(a)</m>, we say that <m>f</m> has a <term>removable discontinuity</term><idx>removable discontinuity</idx> at <m>x = a</m>. This is because if <m>f(a)</m> were redefined to be equal to <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m>, the redefined function would be continuous at <m>x = a</m>, thus <q>removing</q> the discontinuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the left and right limit exist separately, but are not equal, the discontinuity is not removable and is called a <term>jump discontinuity</term><idx>jump discontinuity</idx>.

             <statement>
             <p> Suppose that: </p>
             <ul>
                  <li> <p> the function <m>f</m> is continuous on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> ;</p></li>
                  <li> <p> you pick a value <m>N</m> such that <m>f(a)\leq N \leq f(b)</m> or <m>f(b)\leq N \leq f(a)</m>.</p></li>
             </ul>
<p>Then, there is some input <m>c</m> in the interval <m>[a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c)=N</m>.  </p></statement> </theorem>

    
    <activity xml:id="IVT-ex">
        <introduction>
            <p>    In this activity we will explore a mathematical theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem.</p> 
       </introduction>
 <task>
            <statement>
                <p> To get an idea for the theorem, draw a continuous function <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,10]</m> such that <m>f(0)=8</m> and <m>f(10)=2</m>. Find an input <m>c</m> where <m>f(c)=5</m>.
</p>
            </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
            <statement>
                <p> Now try to draw a graph similar to the previous one, but that does not have any input corresponding to the output 5. Then, find where your graph violates these conditions: <m>f(x) </m> is continuous on <m>[0,10]</m>, <m>f(0)=8</m>, and <m>f(10)=2</m>.
</p>
            </statement>
        </task>
         <task>
            <statement>
                <p> The part of the theorem that starts with “Suppose…” forms the assumptions of the theorem, while the part of the theorem that starts with “Then…” is the conclusion of the theorem. What are the assumptions of the Intermediate Value Theorem? What is the conclusion?
</p> </statement>
<answer>
  <p>
    Assumption:  <p>   The function <m>f</m> is continuous on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> ;</p>
                   <p> If   <m>N</m> is the value between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>  such that <m>f(a)\leq N \leq f(b)</m> or <m>f(b)\leq N \leq f(a)</m>.</p>
  
   Conclusion: There exists at least a number <m>c</m> within <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>  such  that <m> f(c) = k </m>
   </p>
</answer>
 </task>
        <task>
            <statement>
                <p> Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that the function <m>f(x) = x^3  +x -3</m> has a zero (so crosses the <m>x</m>-axis) at some point between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>. (Hint: What interval of <m>x</m> values is being considered here? What is <m>N</m>? Why is <m>N</m> between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>?) </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p>
                <m>f(-1) = -5</m> and <m>f(2)= 7 </m> and <m>N = 0 </m>, since <m>-5 \leq 0 \leq 7</m>
