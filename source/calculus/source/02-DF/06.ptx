  <p> Consider the functions defined below: </p>

        <me>f(x)=\sin((x^2+3x)\cos(2x))</me>
      <me>g(x)=\sin(x^2+3x)\cos(2x)</me>

      What do you notice that is similar about these two functions?
        </p>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Both functions require the chain rule to find their derivatives, and both involve <m>\sin x</m>, <m>x^2+3x</m>, <m>\cos x</m>, and <m>2x</m>

      What do you notice that is different about these two functions?
        </p>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)</m> has one outer function, <m>\sin x</m>, and two inner functions, <m>x^2+3x</m> and <m>\cos(2x)</m>; <m>g(x)</m> has two outside functions, <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos 2x</m>, with <m>x^2+3x</m> being an inside function for <m>\sin x</m>

    Imagine that you are sorting functions into different categories based on how you would differentiate them. In what category (or categories) might these functions fall?
        </p>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)</m> requires the chain rule then the product rule, while <m>g(x)</m> requires the product rule then chain rule.

    <!-- 
        <p> We have learned a lot of rules to help us take derivatives of functions. These rules depend on the algebraic structure of the function and often we see that algebraic structures come up in the names of the rules (e.g., sum/difference, power, product, quotient, ...). To take a derivative, we need to examine how the function is built and then proceed accordingly. Up until now we have not seen many situations where these rules were mixed together. Now we turn our attention to those types of situations. </p>
-->
<p> To take a derivative, we need to examine how the function is built and then proceed accordingly. Below are some questions you might ask yourself as you take the derivative of a function, especially one where multiple rules might need to be used:
   <ol>
        <li> How is this function built algebraically? What kind of function is this? What is the big picture?</li>
        <li> Where do you start?  </li>
        <li> Is there an easier or more convenient way to write the function?  </li>
        <li> Are there products or quotients involved? </li>
        <li> Is this function a composition of two (or more) elementary functions? If so, what are the outside and inside functions? </li>
        <li> What derivative rules will be needed along the way? </li>
    </ol>

      The outermost function is a power function, so we write the power rule derivative before the chain rule piece. Since the inner function is a fraction, its derivative has a quotient rule structure.

            First we use the power rule to get <m>\dfrac{1}{2}(\cos(6y^4-6y))^{-1/2}</m>. From the chain rule, we get the next term <m>-\sin(6y^4-6y)</m>.

            The chain rule (along with the power, constant multiple, and sum/difference rules) gives the derivative of the first function <m>-5(5x^4-7x^3)^4(25x^3-21x^2)</m>. From the product rule, the first term becomes

              -5(5x^4-7x^3)^4(25x^3-21x^2)x^{1/4}

            The derivative of the second function is <m>\dfrac{1}{4}x^{-3/4}</m>, which gives the second product rule term

              -(5x^4-7x^3)^5\left(\dfrac{1}{4}x^{-3/4}\right)
