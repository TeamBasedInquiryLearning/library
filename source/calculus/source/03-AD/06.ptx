    <remark>
      <p> On the leftmost curve in <xref ref="concavity-1"/>,
      as we move from left to right,
      the slopes of the tangent lines will increase.
      Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing,
      and this explains why we say this function is
      <em>increasing at an increasing rate</em>.

 <observation><statement><p> We must be extra careful with our language when dealing with negative numbers.
      For example, it can be tempting to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is bigger than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      But we must remember that <q>greater than</q>
      describes how numbers lie on a number line: <m>-100</m> is less than <m>-2</m> becomes it comes earlier on the number line.
      It might be helpful to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is "more negative" than <m>-2</m>.</q>

<remark xml:id="activity-remark-concavity-terminology"><p>Recall the terminology of concavity: when a curve bends upward, we say its shape is concave up. When a curve bends downwards, we say its shape is concave down.</p></remark>
<!--     <p permid="KZm">
      We now introduce the notion of <em>concavity</em>
          <idx><h>concavity</h></idx>
      which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors.
      When a curve opens upward on a given interval,
      like the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> or the exponential growth function <m>y = e^x</m>,
      we say that the curve is <em>concave up</em> on that interval.
      Likewise, when a curve opens down,
      like the parabola <m>y = -x^2</m> or the opposite of the exponential function <m>y = -e^{x}</m>,
      we say that the function is <em>concave down</em>.
      Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.
