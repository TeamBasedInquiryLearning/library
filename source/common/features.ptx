    <p>
        The book is organized into Modules. You can think of a module as a chapter in a textbook.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a TBIL course, each module starts with a <term>Readiness Assurance Process</term> to check
        understanding of and and solidify prerequisite knowledge (from other courses or previous modules)
        that will be needed in the upcoming module.
        The front page for each module provides a list of these Readiness Assurance outcomes, along with
        study resources and exercise students can use to refresh themselve on this prerequisite knowledge.
        Readiness Assurance Tests that assess this knowledge are available as part of the TBIL Resource Libary 
        (see <xref ref="tbil-rl" text="title"/>).  Join the TBIL community (see <xref ref="preface-community" text="title"/>) to gain 
        access to these.

    <p>
        Within each module there is a varying amount of sections, one per learning outcome. 
        Each section is designed to guide students into being able to demonstrate their 
        understanding of that specific outcome. The learning outcome can be tested with a CheckIt Exercise,
        which are linked at the end of each section.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within each section, students engage in Activities, which are interpersed with definitions, 
        theorems, remarks, examples, etc. as needed to guide the learning process. The activities 
        start in an exploratory way then building the concepts on the results of this exploration. 
        The concepts are then practiced with less scaffolding to build fluency. Finally, towards 
        the end of the section we connect the concepts and extend them to new settings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each section/learning outcome is designed with an exercise, a specific set of tasks, that 
        the students need to be able to solve to demonstrate their competency. Virtually limitless 
        randomized versions of the exercise can be generated via CheckIt to build a problem bank 
        and allow for reassessment.
