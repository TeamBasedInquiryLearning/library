        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> denote the region in the <m>xy</m>-plane that is inside the circle <m>(x-2)^2+y^2=1</m>. 
                If we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis, we obtain a <em>torus</em>, which is fancy word for doughnut.

            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Explain and demonstrate how to set up an integral that computes the volume of this torus using the method of cylindrical shells.

            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Explain and demonstrate how to set up an integral that computes the volume of this torus using the washer method. 
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Use <url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" visual="wolframalpha.com">Wolfram Alpha</url> Wolfram Alpha to evaluate both of the integrals you set up to check that they both evaluate to the same answer. 
                        To help with syntax, here is an example of how one would ask Wolfram Alpha to evaluate <m>\int_0^\frac{\pi}{4} \sin(x)dx</m>:
                        <c>integral of sin(x)dx where x goes from 0 to pi/4</c>
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        After this check, explain and demonstrate how to evaluate <em>one</em> of the two integrals using methods of integrations we've learned in class. 
                        Why did you choose the integral you chose?
                    </p>
