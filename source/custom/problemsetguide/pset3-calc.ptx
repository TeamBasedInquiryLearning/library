                Let <m>R</m> denote the region in the <m>xy</m>-plane that is inside the circle <m>(x-2)^2+y^2=1</m>. 
                If we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis, we obtain a <em>torus</em>, which is fancy word for doughnut.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                In class, we considered the problem of calculating the work involved in pulling a potentially leaky bucket up along a rope. 
                Implicit in the set up of those exercises was the underlying assumption that the rope itself did not weight anything. 
                In this exercise, you'll consider how to modify this model to accommodate a non weight-less rope. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The year is 2011 and you and your accomplice are plotting to steal a bucket of maple syrup weighing a total of 200kg from Canada's strategic Maple Syrup Supply. 
                You'll need to pull this bucket up 10 meters and so you're using a heavy duty rope that weighs 2kg for each meter of rope.

                        You can't go back to NASA empty handed, so you wrote some code using sage to help you estimate the arc-length below. 
                        By editing the code cell below, vary <m>n</m> (which represents the number of pieces we divide the wire into in making an estimate) find some estimates for NASA.
                        You're reasonably confident that if you can estimate the correct length within three decimal points, this will be enough. 
                        Start with <m>n=10, 15, 20</m>, and then trying larger numbers at your discretion. 
                        Based on your experimenting, how large do you think you should take <m>n</m> to be and what do you think is the approximate length?
                    </p>
                    <sage>

                            f(x)=x*exp(-x^2) ###this tells sage what function we're working with
                            a=0 ##this establishes the left endpoint of our interval
                            b=2 ##this establishes the right endpoint
                            n=10 ##this is the number of pieces we cut the wire into. this is what you should vary
                            dx=(b-a)/n ##this is the width of interval
                            k=var("k") ##here, i'm telling sage i want to use "k" as the index variable in the sum
                            ##what follows is the actual sum. you shouldn't alter this line, but if feel free to change the function and starting points above. If you get an error, refresh the activity book to reset this cell
