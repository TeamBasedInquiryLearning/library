        <title>(Problem 1): Application to Traffic Modelling</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                You are working for a traffic consulting firm that is deciding how best to build a bike line in downtown Banff, Canada.
                The centre that you are studying is depicted below; every street is a one-way street with directions as shown, and there are six intersections denoted by <m>A, B, C, D, E,</m> and <m>F</m>.
                The numbers on the perimeter denote the total number of vehicles through the given direction in rush-hour and were obtained by using historical data from the City of Banff.
                In order to provide the City of Banff with the most informed options, you need to determine the unknown traffic flows <m>x_1,\dots, x_7</m> labelled below.

                            Traffic flow counts for a portion of a map of the City of Banff.

            <p>
                For each of the six intersections depicted in <xref ref="BanffIntersection"/>, the total number of vehicles entering the intersection is equal to the total number of vehicles leaving the intersection. 
                For instance, looking at intersection <m>A</m>, we find:
                <me>410+x_5=x_1+200.</me>

                        If so, explain and demonstrate how to find them. 
                        If not, what additional information do you need to ask the City of Banff to collect or otherwise provide for you in order to best inform their design?

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <me>W=\left\{\left[\begin{array}{c}x\\y\\z\\w\end{array}\right]\middle|x+y=3z+2w\right\}.</me>
                The set <m>W</m> is a subspace. Below are two attempted proofs of the fact that <m>W</m> is closed under vector addition. 
                Both of them are invalid; explain why.

                    Then both <m>\vec{u},\vec{v}</m> are elements of <m>W</m>. 
                    Their sum is
                    <me>\vec{w}=\left[\begin{array}{c}3\\3\\2\\0\end{array}\right]</me>
                    and since <me>3+3=3\cdot (2)+2\cdot (0),</me>
                    it follows that <m>\vec{w}</m> is also in <m>W</m> and so <m>W</m> is closed under vector addition.

                    To be in <m>W</m>, we need 
                    <me>(x+a)+(y+b)=3(z+c)+2(w+d).</me>
                    Well, if <me>(x+a)+(y+b)=3(z+c)+2(w+d),</me>
                    then we know that <me>x+y-3z-2w+a+b-3c-2d=0</me>
                    by moving everything over to the left hand side. 
                    Since we are assuming that <m>x+y-3z-2w=0</m> and <m>a+b-3c-2d=0</m>, it follows that
                    <m>0=0</m>, which is true, which proves that vector addition is closed.

        <title>Background Information: The Dot-Product</title>
        <p>
            The purpose of the next few problems are to introduce you to some new definitions and concepts, namely, that of dot product and orthogonality. 
            In doing so, you are being asked to practice working with new definitions and to explore ideas related to them. 
            This short section contains all of the background information you need to complete the problems and you'll get the most learning benefit by working on these exercises without consulting further outside sources. 
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-Dot-Product">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Given two Euclidean vectors <m>\vec{u}=\left[\begin{array}{c}u_{1}\\u_{2}  \\\vdots\\u_{n}\end{array}\right]</m> and <m>\vec{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}v_{1}\\v_{2}  \\\vdots\\v_{n}\end{array}\right]</m>, the <term>dot product</term> of <m>\vec{u}</m> and <m>\vec{v}</m> is defined to be:
                    <me>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v}=\vec{u}=\left[\begin{array}{c}u_{1}\\u_{2}  \\\vdots\\u_{n}\end{array}\right]\bullet\vec{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}v_{1}\\v_{2}  \\\vdots\\v_{n}\end{array}\right]=u_1v_1+u_2v_2+\cdots+u_nv_n.</me>
                    In particular, note that the dot product of two Euclidean vectors is a real number. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dot product satisfies the following properties for any Euclidean vectors <m>\vec{u},\vec{v}</m> and scalar <m>c\in\IR</m>:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v}=\vec{v}\bullet\vec{u}</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>(\vec{u}+\vec{v})\bullet\vec{w}=\vec{u}\bullet\vec{w}+\vec{v}\bullet\vec{w}</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>(c\vec{u})\bullet\vec{v}=c(\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v})=\vec{u}\bullet (c\vec{v})</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{u}\geq 0</m> and, the only way we can have <m>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{u}=\vec{0}</m> is if <m>\vec{u}=\vec{0}.</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <term>length (or norm)</term> of a vector <m>\vec{u}\in\IR^n</m> is denoted by <m>||\vec{u}||</m> and is given by:
                    <me>||\vec{u}||=\sqrt{\vec{u}\bullet\vec{u}}=\sqrt{u_1^2+\cdots u_n^2}.</me>
                    Interpreting the vector <m>\vec{u}</m> as an arrow starting at the origin and point in the direction of <m>\vec{u}</m>, this norm agrees with our usual notion of length. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors. 
                    Consider two vectors <m>\vec{u}</m> and <m>\vec{v}</m> and interpret them as arrows with their tails at the origin. 
                    If <m>\theta</m> denotes the angle between these vectors, then it is computed by using the following formula:
                    <me>\cos\theta=\frac{\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v}}{||\vec{u}||\cdot||\vec{v}||}.</me>
                    In particular, it follows that the vectors <m>\vec{u},\vec{v}</m> are <term>perpendicular (or orthogonal)</term> if and only if
                    <me>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v}=0.</me>
                </p>

                            Using the formulae in <xref ref="def-Dot-Product"/>, we compute:
                            <me>\vec{u}\bullet\vec{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\1\\1\end{array}\right]\bullet\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\2\\3\end{array}\right]=(1)(1)+(1)(2)+(1)(3)=6;</me>
                            <me>||\vec{w}||=\sqrt{1^2+0^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}.</me>
                            To determine the angle between <m>\vec{v}</m> and <m>\vec{w}</m>, we first calculate the following:
                            <md>
                                <mrow>\vec{v}\bullet\vec{w} \amp =(1)(1)+(2)(0)+(3)(1)=4</mrow>
                                <mrow>||\vec{v}|| \amp =\sqrt{1^2+2^2+3^2}=\sqrt{14}.</mrow>
                            </md>
                            This allows us to see that
                            <me>\cos\theta=\frac{\vec{v}\bullet\vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||\cdot||\vec{w}||}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{14}}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{14}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}.</me>
                            It follows that
                            <me>\theta=\arccos\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\right).</me>

                            On the other hand, if we compute <m>\vec{v}\bullet\vec{u}</m>, we get:

                        Another way to describe a plane is to pick a point <m>\vec{p}</m> on the plane and a <em>normal vector</em> <m>\vec{n}</m>; then, the plane is described as the set of all vectors <m>\vec{x}</m> for which <m>\vec{x}-\vec{p}</m> is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <m>W\subseteq\IR^n</m> be a subspace. 
                If <m>\vec{u}\in\IR^n</m> is orthogonal to all vectors in <m>W</m>, we will say that <m>\vec{u}</m> is <em>orthogonal to <m>W</m></em>.
                The set of all vectors <m>\vec{u}</m> that are orthogonal to <m>W</m> is called the <term>orthogonal complement</term> of <m>W</m> and is denoted by <m>W^\perp</m>; in other words, we have
                <me>W^\perp=\{\vec{u}\in\IR^n|\ \vec{u}\bullet {w}=0\ \textrm{for every}\ \vec{w}\in W\}.</me>
            </p>
            <p> 
                For example, if <m>W=\textrm{span}\left\{\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}\right\}</m>, then <m>\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}</m> lives in <m>W^\perp</m> since it's perpendicular to any multiple of <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}</m>, but the vector <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}</m> does not live in <m>W^\perp</m>.
    The set <m>W^\perp</m> is always a subspace, as you will prove below. 
            </p>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Prove that <m>W^\perp</m> is always a subspace of <m>\IR^n</m>.

                        If <m>W=\vspan\{\vec{v}_1,\dots, \vec{v}_n\}</m>, explain why saying that <m>\vec{u}\in W^\perp</m> is the same as saying that <m>\vec{u}</m> is orthogonal to each of the vectors <m>\vec{v}_1,\dots, \vec{v}_n</m> individually.

                        Suppose that <m>W=\vspan\left\{\begin{bmatrix}2\\-1\\1\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\\-3\\7\end{bmatrix}\right\}</m>. 
                        Find a set of vectors that spans <m>W^\perp</m>.
