                        <p>
                            One algebraic approach is to first consider the corresponding augmented matrix:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\
                                3&amp; -3&amp; k\end{array}\right].</me>
                            Using row operations, the corresponding RREF is equal to:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\
                               0 &amp; 0&amp; k-3\end{array}\right].</me>
                            Then, by <xref ref="LE3-fact-scenarios"/>, the linear system is inconsistent whenever <m>k\neq 3</m> and is consistent with infinitely many solutions when <m>k=3</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Geometrically, each of the given linear equations describe lines in the <m>x_1x_2</m>-plane. 
                            Re-writing the equations as follows:
                            <md alignment="alignat" alignat-columns="2">
                                <mrow>
                                        x_1 &amp;\,=\,&amp; 1+x_2
                                </mrow>
                                <mrow>
                                        x_1 &amp;\,=\,&amp;\frac{k}{3}+x_2,

                            </md>
                            we see that the lines have the same slopes, i.e., they are parallel. 
                            It follows that the lines must be identical (in which case the corresponding) solution is infinite, or else they do not intersect at all, in which case there are no solutions. 
                            This corresponds to the case where <m>k=3</m> and <m>k\neq 3</m> respectively.

                            One algebraic approach is to first consider the corresponding augmented matrix:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\
                                3&amp; -k&amp; 3\end{array}\right].</me>
                            Using row operations, the corresponding equivalent to:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\
                               0 &amp; k-3&amp; 0\end{array}\right].</me>
                            If <m>k=3</m>, then this augmented matrix is in RREF and by <xref ref="LE3-fact-scenarios"/>, the system has infinitely many solutions. 
                            Otherwise, when <m>k\neq 3</m>, then the RREF is given by:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
                                0 &amp; 1&amp; 0\end{array}\right]</me>
                            and the linear system is consistent with a unique solution.

                            In the <m>x_1x_2</m>-plane, the first equation describes the line passing through <m>(1,0)</m> with slope equal to <m>1</m>. 
                            The second line corresponds to the line passing through <m>(1,0)</m> with slope equal to <m>\frac{k}{3}</m>. 
                            Two lines passing through the same point are either equal or intersect in a single point (the point of common intersection). 
                            This happens when <m>k=3</m> and <m>k\neq 3</m> respectively, which correspond to the system having infinitely many solutions or a single solution, as desired.

                        A matrix is not an equation, or even a system of equations; a matrix an array of real numbers. 
                        Therefore, it does not make sense to say that <m>B</m> is consistent/inconsistent, let alone speak to how many solutions it has.

                        All of these matrices satisfy the following property: each row is a multiple of the first (and only) non-zero row of the matrix that was given to us.
                        In general, any matrix that we can find that is equivalent to our given matrix must be obtained by apply row operations. 
                        If we start with a matrix, such as this, with only one non-zero row, then our row operations can only create rows that are multiples of this original row, which means that this phenomena was not a coincidence of the examples we wrote down but, rather, will happen generally.

                            This statement is false. 
                            Consider the following augmented matrix:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}1&amp; 0&amp; 4\\0&amp;1&amp; 3\end{array}\right].</me>
                            Then, all columns of the coefficient matrix have a pivot (in particular the right-most), but the system is consistent because the rightmost column of the <em>augmented</em> matrix does not contain a pivot.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This statement is false. 
                            Consider the following augmented matrix:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1\\0&amp; 0&amp;0&amp; 0\\0&amp;0&amp; 0&amp;0\end{array}\right].</me>
                            This matrix corresponds to a linear system that is consistent and for which <m>x_2,x_3</m> are free variables; in particular, the solution set is infinite. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <p>
                            This statement is also false. 
                            The assumptions tell us that, if the system were consistent, then there would be no free variable and, therefore, any solution would be unique.
                            However, the assumptions do not rule out a system corresponding to the following augmented matrix:
                            <me>\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;2\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;5\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{array}\right].</me>
                            This augmented matrix corresponds to a linear system that is inconsistent, despite the coefficient matrix having a pivot in each of its columns.
                        </p>
                    </li>

    <problem>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                Consider the following statement: <q>It is possible for two consistent linear systems to have the same underlying coefficient matrix, but have different numbers of free variables</q>.
                Determine if this statement is true or false. 
                If you think it is true, provide an example that demonstrates as such; if you think it is false, explain why it is not possible to find two such systems.

        <!--<solution>
            <p>
                This statement is false. 
                Indeed, because we are told that the two systems are consistent, the number of free and bound variables is completely determined by the number of columns that contain pivots in their <em>coefficient</em> matrices. 
                Since we're assuming the two systems have the same coefficient matrices, these values must be the same for both systems, even if their right-hand sides are different.
