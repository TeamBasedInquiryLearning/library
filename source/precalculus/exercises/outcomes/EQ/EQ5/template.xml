                There are many ways to solve a quadratic equation, but sometimes it is better to use 
                one particular method. For each equation, determine which method would be the best to use 
                and explain why. You must choose a different method for each equation and cannot use a 
                method more than once.

                Choose two of the equations above and solve using the method you stated 
                is the best to use. Do you still think that method was the best? Why or why not?
