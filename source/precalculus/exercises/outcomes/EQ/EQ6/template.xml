Solve the following rational equations. Give solutions as integers
or fractions, not decimals or approximations.

After eliminating the denominators of
                <m mode="display">{{eq}}</m>
and then simplifying and factoring, you would find
                <m mode="display">{{simp}}</m>
which has two solutions.
Explain why the only solution of the original equation is
<m>x={{sol}}</m>.

        <outtro>
            <!-- {{#explainA}} -->
            <p>
While <m>x={{notsol}}</m> is a solution of
<m>{{simp}}</m>, since <m>({{notsol_term}})</m> appears in a
denominator of <m>{{eq}}</m>, the value <m>{{notsol}}</m> cannot
be a solution.
            </p>
            <!-- {{/explainA}} -->
            <!-- {{#explainB}} -->
            <p>
The term <m>({{notsol_term}})</m> is in a
denominator of <m>{{eq}}</m>, so <m>{{notsol}}</m> is not
in its domain. Thus <m>x={{notsol}}</m> cannot be a solution,
so <m>x={{sol}}</m> is the only solution.
            </p>
            <!-- {{/explainB}} -->
            <!-- {{#explainC}} -->
            <p>
Solutions for <m>{{eq}}</m> must belong to its domain.
Since <m>x={{notsol}}</m> is not in its domain
(you cannot divide by zero), it is not a valid
solution, even though it's a solution for <m>{{simp}}</m>.
            </p>
            <!-- {{/explainC}} -->
            <!-- {{#explainD}} -->
            <p>
Setting each factor of <m>{{simp}}</m> equal to zero, we find
the potential solutions <m>x={{sol}}</m> and <m>x={{notsol}}</m>.
But substituting <m>{{notsol}}</m> into <m>{{eq}}</m> causes division
by zero, so only <m>x={{sol}}</m> is a solution.
