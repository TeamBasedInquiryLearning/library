            between the two lighthouses, and fortunately establishes radio contact with a person in the {{specifier}} lighthouse.
            They report that the lighthouses are <m>{{distance1}}</m> {{units}} apart, and they see an angle of

          <p>A carpenter is trying to determine if two pieces of wood meet at a right angle, and does not have a square.
             One piece of wood is <m>{{distance1}}</m> {{units}} long, and the other is <m>{{distance2}}</m> {{units}} long.
             She measures the distance between the other ends of the pieces of wood as <m>{{distance3}}</m> {{units}}.
             What angle do the two pieces of wood make with each other?
