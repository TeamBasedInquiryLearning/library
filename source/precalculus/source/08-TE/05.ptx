      Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It has a wide range of applications across various fields, including science, engineering, architecture, and more. In this section, we will look at some common ways trigonometry is used.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          A pilot signals to an air traffic controller that she wants to land. She wants to know what angle of fall to take when she is currently at <m>40{,}000</m> feet. Her plane is <m>750{,}000</m> feet from the runway, as the air traffic controller can see on the radar.

            Draw a diagram to represent this situation.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Students should draw a right triangle where the height is <m>40{,}000</m> and the base is <m>750{,}000</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The pilot wants to know what angle of descent to take in order to reach the runway. Where is this angle located in your diagram?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Students may notice that the angle they are looking for is not inside the triangle and the line of sight of the pilot is looking down at the ground.
          </p>
        </answer>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Draw a line that represents the line of sight of the pilot. What do you notice about this line and the base of your triangle?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The pilot's line of sight is parallel to the base of the triangle. 
          </p>
        </answer>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If we know that the pilot's line of sight is parallel to the base of the triangle you created in part (a), then the hypotenuse of the triangle could also be considered a transversal that cuts the two parallel lines.  What angle of the triangle is congruent to the "angle of descent" the pilot wants to take in order to descend the plane <m>750{,}000</m> feet from the runway?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The "angle of descent" is congruent to the same angle that is created with the base of the triangle (not the right angle). 
          </p>
        </answer>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now that we know which angle is congruent to the "angle of descent" the pilot needs, which of the <m>6</m> trig functions could we use to find the angle at which the pilot should descend?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            If students label the triangle correctly, they should see that they can now use <m>\tan^{-1}</m> to find the measure of the angle because they have <m>40{,}000</m> as the opposite side and <m>750{,}000</m> as the adjacent side.

    <remark>
      <p>
      Notice that <xref ref="right-triangles-1"/>, the angle that we needed to find was an angle that was not inside the right triangle. In these cases, it would be helpful to use prior knowledge of parallel lines and angle relationships to determine which other angle is congruent to that given angle.

    <definition xml:id="def-angle-of-depression-and-elevation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Many applications of trigonometry will include the angle of elevation and the angle of depression which are formed by two parallel lines cut by a transversal. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                An <term>angle of elevation</term> is the angle formed by a horizontal line and a line of sight to a point above the line.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An <term>angle of depression</term> is the angle formed by a horizontal line and a line of sight to a point below the line.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> 
          <figure xml:id="angle-of-elevation-and-depression">
            <image source="Images/depression-elevation-angle.jpg"/>
            <caption> The angle of elevation and the angle of depression are congruent.</caption>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that because both the angle of elevation and the angle of depression are formed by horizontal lines that are parallel, the angle of elevation is congruent to the angle of depression (by the alternate interior angles theorem).

      <introduction>
        <p>
          An observer is standing <m>67</m> meters away from the Seattle Space Needle.
        </p>
      </introduction>

          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Students should draw a right triangle so that the base of the triangle is <m>67</m> meters, as it represents the distance the observer is from the Space Needle.

        <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If the angle of elevation from where the observers stands to the top of the Space Needle is <m>70</m><degree/>, which trig function could you use to find the height of the Space Needle?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The tangent function would be the best to use because the opposite of the given angle (angle of elevation) is the height of the Space Needle and the distance from the Space Needle to the observer would be the adjacent side.

        Trigonometric functions can model relationships between different quantities that follow a periodic nature: height over time, distance over time, temperature over time and so on. Scientists observe this back-and-forth movement and collect data so they can model them using an equation or a graph. They then use this information to make predictions for the future.

          The depth of the water in meters at a certain pier varies with the tide and is modeled by the equation <m>d(t)=2+\frac{1}{2}\sin{\frac{\pi}{6}}t</m> where <m>t</m> is the number of hours after <m>10</m> a.m.

            This is really asking for the period. The period of a sine function is <m>\frac{2pi}{b}</m>. In the equation given, the <m>b</m> value is <m>\frac{pi}{6}</m>. Therefore, the period is <m>\frac{2pi}{\frac{pi}{6}}</m>, which is equal to <m>12</m>. So, the time between successive high tides is <m>12</m> hours.

          <p>
            From part (c), we know the period is <m>12</m> hours. So, that means one cycle is <m>12</m> hours, so there are <m>2</m> cycles in a <m>24</m>-hour day.

            Because the diameter of the Ferris wheel is <m>120</m> meters and that the carriage is at its lowest height off the ground at the bottom of the wheel (<m>1</m> meter), the minimum height is <m>1</m> and the maximum height is <m>1+120 = 121</m> meters.

            The period is the amount of time it takes to complete one revolution (or one cycle around the Ferris wheel). We know that it takes <m>24</m> minutes to go around <m>8</m> times, so it must take <m>3</m> minutes to go around once.

        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The cosine function would be the best to use because when people get on a Ferris wheel, they are starting at the minimum of a curve and then does a complete revolution when they ride the Ferris wheel. Because it starts at a minimum, it is really an upside down cosine graph (because the parent function starts at a maximum).
