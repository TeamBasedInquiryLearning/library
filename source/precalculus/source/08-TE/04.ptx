            Let's revisit the triangle <m>ABC</m> from <xref ref="find-trig-function"/>, where <m>a=35</m>, <m>b=12</m>, and <m>c=37</m>, with <m>c</m> being the hypotenuse of the triangle.

            <p>
              Suppose we want to know the measure of angle <m>A</m>. We can find the measure of angle <m>A</m> in three different ways by using either sine, cosine, or tangent (since all side lengths are given). For each trigonometric function, write the trigonometric ratio that can be used to find the measure of angle <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
             Students should be able to write all three trigonometric functions: <m>\cos{A}=\frac{12}{37}</m>, <m>\sin{A}=\frac{35}{37}</m>, and <m>\tan{A}=\frac{35}{12}</m>.

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Now that we have set up a trigonometric ratio to help find the measure of angle <m>A</m>, how can we use these ratios to determine how big <m>A</m> is?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <answer>
            <p>
              Give students the opportunity to discuss with one another on how they would try to determine the measure of angle <m>A</m>. Instructors might want to give a hint about how to "undo" the trigonometric function.

      <remark>
      <p>Sometimes you will need to use inverse trigonometric functions (e.g. <m>\arcsin(x)</m>) to find the measure of an angle. 
        Recall from <xref ref="PF3"/> that the inverse trig function keys on your calculator are usually denoted <m>\sin^{-1}</m>.

        Determining all of the side lengths and angle measures of a right triangle is known as <term>solving</term> a right triangle. In <xref ref="finding-trig-ratios-when-given-all-sides"/> and <xref ref="finding-angle-measures"/>, we were given all the sides of the triangle and used trigonometric ratios to determine the measure of the angles.
