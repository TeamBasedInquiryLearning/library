      <term>Pythagorean triples</term> are integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. <xref ref="finding-length-of-3-4-5-triangle"/> and <xref ref="finding-length-of-5-12-13-triangle"/> highlight some of the most common types of Pythagorean triples: <m>3-4-5</m> and <m>5-12-13</m>.

<definition xml:id="def-sides-of-right-triangles">
  <statement>
    <p>
      When working with right triangles, it is often helpful to refer to specific angles and sides. One way this is done is by using letters, such as <m>A</m> and <m>a</m> to show that these are an angle-side pair because every angle has a side opposite the angle in a triangle. Note that the capital letter indicates the angle, and the lower case letter indicates the side. </p>

      <p>Another way to label the sides of a triangle is to use the relationships between a given angle within a triangle and the sides. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>hypotenuse</term> of a right triangle is always the side opposite the right angle. This side also happens to be the longest side of the triangle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>opposite side</term> is the non-hypotenuse side across from a given angle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>adjacent side</term> is the non-hypotenuse side that is next to a given angle.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When given an angle, all sides of a triangle can be labeled. For example, suppose angle <m>A</m> is given, then the sides of a right triangle can be labeled as:
      <figure xml:id="labeling-sides-of-right-triangle">
        <image source="Images/Defining-sides-of-a-triangle.png"/>

        Suppose you are asked to find one of the sides of the right triangle. What additional information would you need to find the length of another side of the triangle? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Students will probably notice that the Pythagorean Theorem is not helpful in this case because they only know the length of one side. This is a great opportunity to discuss how the Pythagorean Theorem is useful in finding side lengths when at least two sides are known. 
      </p>
    </answer>

<remark>
  <p>
  The Pythagorean Theorem can be very helpful in finding the third side of a right triangle as long as we know the length of two other sides. In <xref ref="intro-to-using-trig"/>, only one side and one angle were given. In this case, the Pythagorean Theorem is not enough to help us find another side of the right triangle (unless it is one of the triples!).

<definition xml:id="def-right-triangle-trigonometry">
  <statement>
    <p>
      <term>Trigonometric ratios</term> such as sine, cosine, and tangent are based on the relationships between a given angle <m>\theta</m> and side lengths in a right triangle. Three trigonometric functions, sine, cosine, and tangent, are often used to understand the relationships between a given angle of a triangle and its sides. For acute angles, such as <m>\theta</m>, these functions can be defined as ratios between the sides of a right triangle. 
        <md> 
          <mrow>
            \sin\theta=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}

  <remark>
  <p>Sometimes you will need to use trigonometric functions to find the measure of an angle. In these cases, you will need to use the inverse trig function key on your calculator, such as <m>\sin^{-1}</m>, to find the angle that yields that trig value.
  </p>
  <p> For example, the sine function takes an angle and gives us the ratio <m>\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}</m>, but <m>\sin^{-1}</m> (called "inverse sine") takes the ratio <m>\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}</m> and gives us an angle.

    Determining all of the side lengths and angle measures of a right triangle is known as <term>solving</term> a right triangle. In <xref ref="finding-trig-ratios-when-given-all-sides"/> and <xref ref="finding-angle-measures"/>, we were given all the sides of the triangle and used trigonometric ratios to determine the measure of the angles.
