        <p>
          Any value of <m>x</m> less than <m>-3</m> or greater than or equal to <m>1</m> will satisfy the inequality. In interval notation, the solution is <m>(-\infty, -3) \cup [1, \infty)</m> (although students may not know this at this point in the section).

  <remark>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="intro-to-rational-inequality"/>, we saw that there can be solutions to the rational inequality <m>\frac{x-1}{x+3} \ge 0</m> that does NOT satisfy the rational equation <m>\frac{x-1}{x+3}= 0</m>. Just like with linear and quadratic inequalities, we can have many solutions that can satisfy rational inequalities. We do, however, need to be careful about our critical points, as we will see in the next activity.

        The value you got in part (a) is a critical value for this rational expression because it is a value of <m>x</m> where the rational expression is undefined. Critical points for rational expressions also include values that make the rational expression equal to <m>0</m>. What value of <m>x</m> would make this rational expression equal to <m>0</m>?

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the critical points you found in parts (a) and (b) and plot them on a number line. Determine whether those should be included in your solution based on the inequality that was given.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        The value <m>1</m> IS a solution to the inequality because although it makes the rational expression equal to <m>0</m>, the inequality states "greater than or equal to <m>0</m>." The other critical value, <m>-3</m>, however should be in the solution as it makes the rational expression undefined. So, on a number line, <m>-3</m> should have a parentheses and <m>1</m> should have a bracket.

        Notice that  your number line has now been divided into three regions. Test values of <m>x</m> in each region that was created by the critical points and create a sign chart to show which regions are positive and negative.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        When solving an inequality, the goal is to first get <m>x</m> (or whatever the variable is) on its own on one side of the inequality sign and <m>0</m> on the other side. To do this, we have to be careful of the actions we take as some actions can change the direction of the inequality. Let's revisit some of the actions we have taken previously and see how we can apply these same actions to solve the rational inequality <me>\frac{3x-10}{x-4} \gt 2</me>.

          When solving rational equations in <xref ref="PR6"/>, we often started by "clearing the fractions" by multiplying the denominator to both sides of the equation. Suppose we have the equation <m>\frac{3x-10}{x-4} = 2</m>. What can we multiply each term by that will clear the fraction?

  <remark>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="rational-inequality-clearing-fractions-method"/>, we saw that it is not clear whether the denominator of a rational expression would yield a positive or negative value. Because we do not actually know whether the denominator is positive or negative, we cannot multiply the denominator to "clear the fractions" as we did before when solving rational equations. In the next activity, we will look at how we can solve rational inequalities.

      <hint>
        <p>
          Remember that for a rational inequality, the critical points are the values of <m>x</m> that make the rational expression equal to <m>0</m> or undefined.

      <answer>
        <p>
          Both values of <m>x</m> should be excluded from the solution. On the number line, they would have parentheses (or open circles).
