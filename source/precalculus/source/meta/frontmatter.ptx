      <title>Welcome to our first edition!</title>
   
      <p>
We're excited to share with you our first edition of
Precalculus for Team-Based Inquiry Learning! These activities, which mostly
cover topics from College Algebra, are being
used in a few classrooms for the first time in Fall 2024. More
activities are being designed to be included in our 2025 editions,
with a goal of fully supporting Precalculus courses in Fall 2025.
Similarly, our exercise bank is a work-in-progress.
      </p>
      <p>
We're providing this first edition for those who are eager to try out
TBIL in their precalculus classrooms, with the understanding that this
book will likely change a lot between now and our next edition, once we've
tried it in our own classrooms! Are you interested in joining the community
using these materials, and possibly contributing back to these free and
open-source resources? Join the conversation at <url href="http://chat.tbil.org"/>;
we look forward to hearing from you, particularly if you have feedback
from your students on these activities.
